1	1	Truth about blockchain
1	0.6505	There are many misleading stories about blockchain. Much of the stories are about cryptocurrencies that led to incredible wealth or nightmare losses, or form the basis for a new financial system that supports dark markets for weapons or drugs. Blockchain is also considered a technology with enormous energy requirements. The variety of design and application possibilities of this technology and the opportunities thvat result from it are omitted from these stories.
181	0.5974	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
39	0.5738	Experts cite several important benefits for using blockchain. Security is considered one of the main advantages of this technology. It is almost impossible to manipulate a blockchain because information from thousands, even millions of computers, is shared and constantly compared with each other. In addition, blockchain does not have a singular point of failure. If one node fails, this is not a problem because all other nodes have a copy of the ledger. Whether blockchain will revolutionize the way public administration, institutions and industries work is an open question.
40	0.5708	Articles in the press have questioned whether blockchain technologies, as they exist now, are sufficiently reliable to deploy on a large scale. Topics include the lack of regulations for this new form of exchange and safety concerns. Blockchains are usually associated with digital currencies such as Bitcoin or alternative versions. However, the fact is that blockchain applications are being researched in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all kinds.
158	0.5698	A blockchain is a distributed, shared, and digital ledger that records the timing of validated facts. These facts can refer to tangible and intangible objects, to money or simply to information. As part of this digital system of recording, each transaction and its details are validated and then recorded in a network of computers. Anyone who has access to the distributed ledger can view this information. All actors on the network agree on the accuracy of the transaction data before the block is replicated, shared, and synchronized between the distributed locations.
2	0.5587	This course explains blockchain beyond this garish and sensational image. Blockchain is above all a technology for distributed, flexible and individualized data management. Essentially, the data refers to participants, documents and transactions that change the status and characteristics of the participants or the things described in the documents.
159	0.5492	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
36	0.5416	Some believe that individuals can use this technology to have better control over personal information and then selectively share parts of their data when necessary; Use cases here include individual medical records and corporate supply chains. In addition, proponents also say blockchains can help better track intellectual property rights and property for art, assets, music, film, and more. Blockchain offers a radically different approach. It firmly manifests the feasibility of peer-to-peer communication over the Internet without the need for a trusted intermediary.
173	0.5339	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
65	0.5300	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
2		Blockchain demystified: Distributed data management.

Essentially, the data refers to participants, documents and transactions that change the status and characteristics of the participants or the things described in the documents.
22	0.5851	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
215	0.5728	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
173	0.5723	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
168	0.5546	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
129	0.5431	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.

3		Blockchain: Grouped distributed consensus technology.
22	0.6187	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
3	0.6187	Strictly speaking, blockchain and distributed technology is less a technology itself, but rather a technology group that can be characterized, at least from an algorithmic point of view, via a protocol of chaining, distribution, and consensus. The basic principles have been known for a long time and have also been used in the context of public data security.
19	0.5905	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
126	0.5805	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.

For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains.

Anyone who has access to the distributed ledger can view this information. All actors on the network agree on the accuracy of the transaction data before the block is replicated, shared, and synchronized between the distributed locations.
166	0.5460	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
44	0.5371	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
213	0.5284	The consensus algorithm contains the so-called trilemma: security, scalability and decentralization. In order to increase scalability and also the processing speed in a blockchain, security must be reduced (transition from PoW to PoS, for example) or decentralization (PoA). Processing speed is a serious problem with blockchains. Bitcoin, for example, creates a throughput of seven transactions per second. Visa's system comes to about 1700 transactions per second with central data storage. This means that blockchains are only accepted if there are no significant differences in performance to central systems.
43	0.5282	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
4		Decentralized chain of linked blocks.
19	0.5673	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
168	0.5113	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
140	0.5041	The result of incorporating these two new blocks into the blockchain is a data structure that contains three branches. One of the branches consists of only three blocks, while the other two consist of four blocks. The criterion of the longest chain clearly excludes the shortest chain. However, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result during this, as it gives two chains of the same length. As a result, some actors may try to find a new block that refers to block BB11 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that refers to block CCC1 as its predecessor.
173	0.4821	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
135	0.4748	The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the longest chain is based on the idea that the blockchain data structure, which includes the most blocks, represents the greater computational effort. Let's look for a starting point in which all actors of a distributed system have agreed on the same version of an existing blockchain:
50	0.4743	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.
159	0.4715	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
164	0.4695	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus. Permissionless or public blockchains offer a platform for new business models. However, by definition, they are based on a very computationally intensive computational model to ensure transaction integrity.
154	0.4669	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
145	0.4615	Following the selection of a chain. Selecting a particular chain from conflicting versions and determining it as the authoritative order has the following consequences: Orphaned blocks. Reclaimed renumeration. Clarification of ownership. Preparation of transactions. A growing common tribe. Robustness against manipulation
5		Information on transactions and participants.
5	0.6588	Transaction data is information about transactions. They usually refer to the time of the transaction, the participants executing or affecting the transaction, and the things or assets to which the transaction relates. A transaction can be considered as a sequence of an exchange of information for a specific purpose (e.g. sale of a bond). The exchange of information is considered a closed unit. Transaction data can be financial, logistical, or production-related in nature and can relate to a purchase, delivery status, hours worked, insurance premium, or claim.
70	0.5364	The complete history of transaction data is a process chain that provides information about how people acquired and transferred ownership. Any transaction that is not part of this history is considered as if it never happened. A transaction is executed by adding it to the history of the transaction data. The order in which transaction data is added to the history must be preserved. Only transaction data that meets the following three criteria are added to the Blockchain: Formal correctness. Semantic correctness. Authorization
69	0.5036	Transaction history management. Because the transaction data contains all the information about the account that hands over ownership, the account that receives the property, as well as the item and amount to be transferred, ownership information can be reconstructed for each account as long as the entire transaction history is available. As a result, the entire history of all transaction data is sufficient to document ownership
47	0.4816	The concept of the ledger has its origins in double-entry bookkeeping, where each posting on one account requires a corresponding and opposite posting on another account. This helps to detect errors. In the context of blockchain, a ledger is an indelible log of transactions that take place between different participants. A ledger records which transaction took place (Participant A has transferred asset X to participant B) and in what order these transactions took place (Participant A transfers asset X to participant B. Subsequently, participant B transfers amount Y of a currency to participant A).
25	0.4736	Transaction: Two parties decide to exchange a thing (property, certificate, etc.). Block: The transaction is packaged with other pending transactions creating a „block“. The block is sent to the blockchain network of participating computers.  Verification: The participating computers (called “miners” in the Bitcoin world) determine whether the transactions are valid. If a majority of computers declare the transactions valid, they are considered valid and a “consensus” among the participants has been reached. Blockchain and its processes (continued) Hash: Each verified block of transactions is time-stamped with a cryptographic hash. Each block holds a reference to the previous block’s hash value. This results in a chain of blocks that can hardly be tampered. Execution: The unit of value moves from the account of one party to the account of the other party.
6	0.4682	Transaction data related to a specific item, document, or asset is mapped in a blockchain, which in turn is stored in a ledger along with all other blockchains. A document can be a patient file, the presentation of a claim, a certificate of completion or a certificate. The documents can also describe assets, such as land, holdings or cars. But they can also refer to goods or services.
116	0.4403	The challenge is to store all transaction data that has ever taken place in such a way that the order in which the transactions took place is preserved and changes to the data are detected quickly and easily. The rapid detection of changes is important to prevent manipulation of the transaction history.
129	0.4397	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
187	0.4379	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.
127	0.4334	Whether a transaction is valid is therefore decided by the majority of actors. However, not all actors are asked for their opinions. The consensus should be reached automatically. There are several mechanisms for designing and implementing an automated consensus. In principle, any actor can propose a transaction that is posted to the ledger. At a certain point in time, however, only one transaction is selected for posting. All honest actors agree on which transaction was selected (agreement), all honest participants finally learn which was the selected transaction (closing) and that the selected transaction was considered valid (validity).

A document can be a patient file, the presentation of a claim, a certificate of completion or a certificate. The documents can also describe assets, such as land, holdings or cars. But they can also refer to goods or services.
45	0.6077	This chapter describes the central element of blockchain technology: the ledger or, to German, the ledger. It explains the architecture of the ledger and the functions and mechanisms for the forgery-proof storage of transaction data.
189	0.5949	The exact temporal assignment (time stamp) and the immutability of the transaction data is an important aspect of blockchains. Once stored, data can no longer be changed. This can be a problem if the General Data Protection Regulation gives users the right to be forgotten and all of a user's personal data must be deleted. Any design of a blockchain that is contrary to legal regulations is automatically doomed to failure. In the present case, it makes sense to separate the personal data from the actual transaction data via a link.
70	0.5822	The complete history of transaction data is a process chain that provides information about how people acquired and transferred ownership.

Essentially, the data refers to participants, documents and transactions that change the status and characteristics of the participants or the things described in the documents.
26	0.5737	A blockchain ledger consists of two types of records, individual transactions and blocks. The first block consists of a header and data related to transactions that take place within a specified period of time. The block's timestamp is used to create an alphanumeric string called a hash (a type of unique fingerprint of the transaction).
129	0.5657	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed.

7		Central data management: basics
7	0.7653	Centralized and decentralized data managing. Central data management. In central systems, the components are arranged around a central component and connected to it. In contrast, the components of distributed systems form a network of connected components without having central elements of coordination or control. Centralized databases have been used by organizations for many years to store customer data and transaction records of one type or another, among other things.
9	0.5572	Central data management carries the risk of single point of failure (SPOF). A SPOF is generally a potential risk arising from an error in the design, implementation, or configuration of a system, where this error or malfunction causes the overall system to become functional. In an IT environment, a single point of failure can thwart the availability of IT services. Imagine an IT environment in which a single server runs a specific application. If the server were to fail, all services accessing this application would also fail or at least behave unstable.
176	0.4855	Hidden centrality. The need to solve a puzzle for each block added to the blockchain data structure, and the rules for distributing rewards that contribute to the integrity of the system, lead to an arms race between actors in terms of their computing power. The supposedly large and democratic group of actors who together maintain the integrity of the system eventually become a very small group of actors who have enormous computing power, often in the form of specialized hardware.
8	0.4765	There are carefully monitored and closed systems in which only privileged users are allowed to make entries. For example, when a customer transfers money from one bank account to another, they ask the bank to do so on their behalf instead of dealing directly with the bank's transaction system. Centralization is associated with the paradigm of central control. This has other implications. A central system is a system that, by definition, has a critical source of failure. It also implies a concentration of power when some privileged users have the prerogative to manipulate transactions, for example, for unilaterally canceling a transaction or charging fees.

14	0.4277	This requires the presence of acommunication protocol, as well as the sending, receiving, and processing of messages.  Security issues: Sending data over a network implies security concerns, as untrusted users may misuse the network to access and use data without authorization. The less restricted access to the network over which the distributed nodes communicate, the higher the security concerns for the distributed system. Decentralized communication with equal nodes.
11	0.4239	Advantages of distributed systems  over single and powerful computers (which are necessary for central systems): Higher computing power: The computing power of a distributed system results from the combination of the computing power of all connected computers. Therefore, distributed systems usually have more computing power than any individual computer. Cost reduction: The cost of creating, maintaining, and operating a central supercomputer is much higher than the cost  of creating, maintaining, and operating a distributed system.
13	0.4144	An increase in computer performance is possible by connecting additional computers to the system. The disadvantages of distributed systems compared to central individual computers are: Coordination effort: Distributed systems do not have central entities that coordinate their members. Coordination must be carried out by the members of the system themselves. Communication effort: Coordination requires communication. Computers that form a distributed system must communicate with each other.

179	0.4607	Critical size. The robustness against manipulation and thus the trustworthiness of the collectively maintained transaction data history is based on the assumption that the majority of the computing power of the system is controlled by honest actors. However, in small peer-to-peer systems with limited computing power, this majority can still be very small, which in turn could allow a 51 percent attack to be carried out.

The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
215	0.4512	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
188	0.4387	Decision on transparency vs. data protection. When you make a decision about the conflict between transparency and privacy, you need to decide who you want to give read access to. If only extreme cases where read access is granted are considered, there are two options: grant read access to everyone or grant read access to only a limited group of actors. · Public blockchains grant all actors read access and the right to create new transactions. · Private blockchains restrict read access and the right to record new transactions to a select group of actors.
11	0.4267	Advantages of distributed systems  over single and powerful computers (which are necessary for central systems): Higher computing power: The computing power of a distributed system results from the combination of the computing power of all connected computers. Therefore, distributed systems usually have more computing power than any individual computer. Cost reduction: The cost of creating, maintaining, and operating a central supercomputer is much higher than the cost  of creating, maintaining, and operating a distributed system.
9		Central data management: risk of SPOF
9	0.8098	Central data management carries the risk of single point of failure (SPOF). A SPOF is generally a potential risk arising from an error in the design, implementation, or configuration of a system, where this error or malfunction causes the overall system to become functional. In an IT environment, a single point of failure can thwart the availability of IT services. Imagine an IT environment in which a single server runs a specific application. If the server were to fail, all services accessing this application would also fail or at least behave unstable.
10	0.6170	The loss of data can also result from the server failure. If a SPOF poses a serious threat, a second (or even third) server is often deployed that can mirror the services of the first server and take on its role in the event of a failure.

In contrast, the components of distributed systems form a network of connected components without having central elements of coordination or control. Centralized databases have been used by organizations for many years to store customer data and transaction records of one type or another, among other things.
179	0.4103	Critical size. The robustness against manipulation and thus the trustworthiness of the collectively maintained transaction data history is based on the assumption that the majority of the computing power of the system is controlled by honest actors. However, in small peer-to-peer systems with limited computing power, this majority can still be very small, which in turn could allow a 51 percent attack to be carried out.
176	0.4040	Hidden centrality. The need to solve a puzzle for each block added to the blockchain data structure, and the rules for distributing rewards that contribute to the integrity of the system, lead to an arms race between actors in terms of their computing power. The supposedly large and democratic group of actors who together maintain the integrity of the system eventually become a very small group of actors who have enormous computing power, often in the form of specialized hardware.

For example, when a customer transfers money from one bank account to another, they ask the bank to do so on their behalf instead of dealing directly with the bank's transaction system. Centralization is associated with the paradigm of central control. This has other implications. A central system is a system that, by definition, has a critical source of failure. It also implies a concentration of power when some privileged users have the prerogative to manipulate transactions, for example, for unilaterally canceling a transaction or charging fees.
116	0.3436	The challenge is to store all transaction data that has ever taken place in such a way that the order in which the transactions took place is preserved and changes to the data are detected quickly and easily.

15		Peer-to-peer systems: basics
15	0.8100	Peer-to-peer systems are a special kind of distributed systems. They consist of individual. computers that make their computing resources directly available to all other members of the network without a central coordination point. When joining a peer-to-peer system, users turn their computers into node computers of the system that are the same in terms of their rights and roles. All nodes in the system have the same functionality and responsibility. All users' computers are both providers and consumers of resources.
16	0.7714	A peer-to-peer network is a decentralized communication model in which each node on the network has the same capabilities and can establish communication with all other nodes. Unlike the client-server model, where the client sends a request to a server that is implemented by it, in the P2P network each node can assume the role of client or server. P2P systems can be used to provide anonymized routing of data traffic, parallel computing environments, distributed data storage and other functions. P2P has historically gained notoriety through the sharing of movies, music, digital books and other media.
17	0.6252	P2P systems can be used to provide anonymized routing of data traffic, parallel computing environments, distributed data storage and other functions. P2P has historically gained notoriety through the sharing of movies, music, digital books and other media. It is, therefore, often associated with software piracy and copyright infringement.
51	0.5909	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
18	0.5782	As a rule, peer-to-peer applications allow their users to control many parameters: How many node connections should be searched for or allowed at the same time, which systems should the network connect to and which should not, which services should be offered and how many system resources should be made available for the network. Some nodes may limit themselves to simply connecting to a subset of active nodes on the network. In principle, however, there is little user control in P2P networks.
50	0.5563	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.
44	0.5053	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
168	0.4944	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
59	0.4881	Double spending is one of the most important examples of integrity breaches in distributed peer-to-peer systems. After transferring ownership from one person to another, all ledgers of the system must be updated so that the latest version reflects the new reality.  However, sharing information between members in the blockchain system and updating individual ledgers will take time. Some members already know about the last transfer of ownership, while others have not yet received this information. At this point, the system is not consistent.  
65	0.4680	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.

7	0.4008	Centralized and decentralized data managing. Central data management. In central systems, the components are arranged around a central component and connected to it. In contrast, the components of distributed systems form a network of connected components without having central elements of coordination or control. Centralized databases have been used by organizations for many years to store customer data and transaction records of one type or another, among other things.
168	0.3892	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
3	0.3879	Strictly speaking, blockchain and distributed technology is less a technology itself, but rather a technology group that can be characterized, at least from an algorithmic point of view, via a protocol of chaining, distribution, and consensus. The basic principles have been known for a long time and have also been used in the context of public data security.
12	0.3776	In particular, the replacement of individual computers of a distributed system can be done without significant effects on the overall system. Higher reliability: A distributed system  does not have a single point of failure. The reliability of a distributed system is based on the fact that the entire computer network can continue to work even in the event of a crash of individual computers. The ability to grow naturally. The computing power of a distributed system results from the aggregated computing power of its components.
17		Anonymized routing
204	0.4333	Alice thought to have miners, identified by their IP addresses, vote via the Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm used in the frozen fish example. However, this idea turns out to be not a good one. Alice’s nemesis, Kate, is skilled in the art of manufacturing fake IP addresses. So, Kate could easily overwhelm any voting scheme simply by flooding the protocol with fake miners who only appear to be independent, but are all under control of Kate.
156	0.4078	However, it is impossible for any attacker who has less computing power than the majority to take a new path, catching up with and overtaking the path taken by the majority. Therefore, any attempt to set up a new authorized path that contains fraudulent transactions will be overtaken and rejected by the path maintained by the honest majority. As a result, the history of transactions managed by the system is robust against manipulation.
185	0.3908	However, this approach is contrary to the concept of privacy. Privacy means that transactional data, or details of how the accounts involved or the amount transferred, should remain hidden from the public. The resulting conflict consists, on the one hand, in the transparency required to clarify ownership and, on the other hand, in the higher data protection requirements of users.
17	0.3857	P2P systems can be used to provide anonymized routing of data traffic, parallel computing environments, distributed data storage and other functions. P2P has historically gained notoriety through the sharing of movies, music, digital books and other media. It is, therefore, often associated with software piracy and copyright infringement.
14	0.3625	This requires the presence of acommunication protocol, as well as the sending, receiving, and processing of messages.  Security issues: Sending data over a network implies security concerns, as untrusted users may misuse the network to access and use data without authorization. The less restricted access to the network over which the distributed nodes communicate, the higher the security concerns for the distributed system. Decentralized communication with equal nodes.
16	0.3387	A peer-to-peer network is a decentralized communication model in which each node on the network has the same capabilities and can establish communication with all other nodes. Unlike the client-server model, where the client sends a request to a server that is implemented by it, in the P2P network each node can assume the role of client or server. P2P systems can be used to provide anonymized routing of data traffic, parallel computing environments, distributed data storage and other functions. P2P has historically gained notoriety through the sharing of movies, music, digital books and other media.
46	0.3331	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
52	0.3096	The problem of achieving and maintaining integrity and trust in a system consisting of an unknown number of members with unknown trustworthiness is well known and widely used in computer science. It is called the problem of Byzantine generals.
233	0.2960	Paper-based systems tend to be less suitable for tracking. The blockchain's immutable, robust records, secure mapping at the time of creation, and the use of smart contracts can make monitoring customs border trade more efficient and transparent. Information about goods such as customs declarations, proof of origin and purchase or loading lists can become part of an accessible block for suppliers, transporters, buyers, regulators and auditors. Increased transparency of the use of blockchain in traceability leads to lower transaction, audit and accounting costs.
189	0.2955	The exact temporal assignment (time stamp) and the immutability of the transaction data is an important aspect of blockchains. Once stored, data can no longer be changed. This can be a problem if the General Data Protection Regulation gives users the right to be forgotten and all of a user's personal data must be deleted. Any design of a blockchain that is contrary to legal regulations is automatically doomed to failure. In the present case, it makes sense to separate the personal data from the actual transaction data via a link.
18		User control in peer-to-peer networks.
18	0.7245	As a rule, peer-to-peer applications allow their users to control many parameters: How many node connections should be searched for or allowed at the same time, which systems should the network connect to and which should not, which services should be offered and how many system resources should be made available for the network. Some nodes may limit themselves to simply connecting to a subset of active nodes on the network. In principle, however, there is little user control in P2P networks.
15	0.6205	Peer-to-peer systems are a special kind of distributed systems. They consist of individual. computers that make their computing resources directly available to all other members of the network without a central coordination point. When joining a peer-to-peer system, users turn their computers into node computers of the system that are the same in terms of their rights and roles. All nodes in the system have the same functionality and responsibility. All users' computers are both providers and consumers of resources.

51	0.5156	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.

179	0.4842	Critical size. The robustness against manipulation and thus the trustworthiness of the collectively maintained transaction data history is based on the assumption that the majority of the computing power of the system is controlled by honest actors. However, in small peer-to-peer systems with limited computing power, this majority can still be very small, which in turn could allow a 51 percent attack to be carried out.
168	0.4535	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger.

36	0.4500	Some believe that individuals can use this technology to have better control over personal information and then selectively share parts of their data when necessary; Use cases here include individual medical records and corporate supply chains. In addition, proponents also say blockchains can help better track intellectual property rights and property for art, assets, music, film, and more. Blockchain offers a radically different approach. It firmly manifests the feasibility of peer-to-peer communication over the Internet without the need for a trusted intermediary.
65	0.4411	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.

45	0.6697	This chapter describes the central element of blockchain technology: the ledger or, to German, the ledger. It explains the architecture of the ledger and the functions and mechanisms for the forgery-proof storage of transaction data.
23	0.6539	Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to speed up transactions by eliminating the need for a central instance. Similarly, distributed ledgers have the potential to reduce costs per transaction. Experts also believe that distributed ledger technology is much more secure because each node of the network contains records, creating a system that is more difficult to manipulate or successfully attack. Many also view a distributed ledger as a much more transparent way of sharing shared data and information and observing it together across a network, which also makes a successful cyberattack less likely.

47	0.6384	The concept of the ledger has its origins in double-entry bookkeeping, where each posting on one account requires a corresponding and opposite posting on another account. This helps to detect errors. In the context of blockchain, a ledger is an indelible log of transactions that take place between different participants. A ledger records which transaction took place (Participant A has transferred asset X to participant B) and in what order these transactions took place (Participant A transfers asset X to participant B. Subsequently, participant B transfers amount Y of a currency to participant A).

On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
24	0.6260	In summary, it can be said: 1· A blockchain or distributed ledger is a new way to store and transmit information. 2· In the simplest case, the blockchain is a digital record stored on a network of computers (possibly even worldwide). 3· Instead of securing information by restricting access, the blockchain shares information among all users. 4· Ownership of assets, for example, is cryptographically verified and the full transparency and shared ownership of the system (among all users) means that a bad actor is immediately recognizable as such and all transactions transmitted by such a node are ignored.
48	0.6235	The ledgers are accessible to all participants registered on a particular network (private blockchain), or to the public as a whole (public blockchain). Ledgers are tamper-proof:  no participant can add, delete or change ledger entries once saved.

159	0.5599	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus.

184	0.5760	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
163	0.5595	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
24		Blockchain - summary
2	0.5827	This course explains blockchain beyond this garish and sensational image. Blockchain is above all a technology for distributed, flexible and individualized data management. Essentially, the data refers to participants, documents and transactions that change the status and characteristics of the participants or the things described in the documents.
62	0.5529	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
26	0.5444	A blockchain ledger consists of two types of records, individual transactions and blocks. The first block consists of a header and data related to transactions that take place within a specified period of time. The block's timestamp is used to create an alphanumeric string called a hash (a type of unique fingerprint of the transaction).

Much of the stories are about cryptocurrencies that led to incredible wealth or nightmare losses, or form the basis for a new financial system that supports dark markets for weapons or drugs. Blockchain is also considered a technology with enormous energy requirements. The variety of design and application possibilities of this technology and the opportunities thvat result from it are omitted from these stories.
158	0.5213	A blockchain is a distributed, shared, and digital ledger that records the timing of validated facts. These facts can refer to tangible and intangible objects, to money or simply to information. As part of this digital system of recording, each transaction and its details are validated and then recorded in a network of computers. Anyone who has access to the distributed ledger can view this information. All actors on the network agree on the accuracy of the transaction data before the block is replicated, shared, and synchronized between the distributed locations.

Presentation of a proof of concept. Performing tests initially with limited functionality, but which offer a certain user experience. Later, more data and more interaction are underpinned. Complete rollout of the production system.
136	0.5092	Each of the boxes represents a block marked with a shortened hash value. The arrow pointing from one box to another represents the hash reference that links a block header to its predecessor. In this initial situation, all actors agree on a history of the transaction data and strive for an extension of the existing chain by another block, which refers to block A397 as its predecessor. If a transaction is now proposed for accounting, a new block is written for the blockchain. The following order is the one that the majority of actors will find once the new block has been added.
168	0.5034	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
42	0.4969	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
45	0.4908	This chapter describes the central element of blockchain technology: the ledger or, to German, the ledger. It explains the architecture of the ledger and the functions and mechanisms for the forgery-proof storage of transaction data.
25		Blockchain and its processes
62	0.6156	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
2	0.5819	This course explains blockchain beyond this garish and sensational image. Blockchain is above all a technology for distributed, flexible and individualized data management. Essentially, the data refers to participants, documents and transactions that change the status and characteristics of the participants or the things described in the documents.
181	0.5810	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
25	0.5774	Transaction: Two parties decide to exchange a thing (property, certificate, etc.). Block: The transaction is packaged with other pending transactions creating a „block“. The block is sent to the blockchain network of participating computers.  Verification: The participating computers (called “miners” in the Bitcoin world) determine whether the transactions are valid. If a majority of computers declare the transactions valid, they are considered valid and a “consensus” among the participants has been reached. Blockchain and its processes (continued) Hash: Each verified block of transactions is time-stamped with a cryptographic hash. Each block holds a reference to the previous block’s hash value. This results in a chain of blocks that can hardly be tampered. Execution: The unit of value moves from the account of one party to the account of the other party.
228	0.5773	The advantage of a blockchain solution lies in the creation of a uniform information on the status of asylum procedures that crosses the organization. This level of information is visible, comprehensible and cannot be manipulated by all authorities involved and forms the basis for improving process integrity. Smart contracts can also support the management of these processes and enable the establishment of an inter-agency process management system in the future. In addition, a blockchain solution can support decentralized data storage and thus contribute in particular to the data sovereignty of the individual authorities.
158	0.5757	A blockchain is a distributed, shared, and digital ledger that records the timing of validated facts. These facts can refer to tangible and intangible objects, to money or simply to information. As part of this digital system of recording, each transaction and its details are validated and then recorded in a network of computers. Anyone who has access to the distributed ledger can view this information. All actors on the network agree on the accuracy of the transaction data before the block is replicated, shared, and synchronized between the distributed locations.
207	0.5585	With a blockchain in which all financial actors are involved, a money transfer can be executed in seconds, at almost disappearing transaction costs. However, there are other sectors that are also using blockchain in the meantime, such as healthcare, energy, human resources, real estate trading, education and others. A variety of industries could benefit from the use of smart contracts that control supply chains and record the corresponding transactions on a blockchain.
34	0.5582	The areas of application are manifold and can certainly not be described conclusively here. Much of the early interest in blockchain technology arose around its application in financial transactions. This is understandable when you consider that the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been used worldwide, proving that blockchain technology can actually work. Banks and other financially relevant institutions have also become early innovators in this area. Other industries, including healthcare, the public sector, agriculture, energy, and many more, are exploring how they can use blockchain to enable the secure exchange of data such as personal health information, digital assets, or real estate data.

The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
37	0.5546	For a company, blockchain offers the following basic possibilities: A design approach that keeps transaction data, value, and status inherently close to business logic. The necessary data schemas for transactional data are easier to manage. Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.
26		Two types of records
26	0.4445	A blockchain ledger consists of two types of records, individual transactions and blocks. The first block consists of a header and data related to transactions that take place within a specified period of time. The block's timestamp is used to create an alphanumeric string called a hash (a type of unique fingerprint of the transaction).
82	0.4314	Each record contains a hash reference to a different record. Such a structure is useful for storing and linking data that is not completely available at a given time, but arrives step by step continuously. The most recent reference is also known as the head of the chain because it references the currently added record.
6	0.3830	Transaction data related to a specific item, document, or asset is mapped in a blockchain, which in turn is stored in a ledger along with all other blockchains. A document can be a patient file, the presentation of a claim, a certificate of completion or a certificate. The documents can also describe assets, such as land, holdings or cars. But they can also refer to goods or services.
47	0.3591	The concept of the ledger has its origins in double-entry bookkeeping, where each posting on one account requires a corresponding and opposite posting on another account. This helps to detect errors. In the context of blockchain, a ledger is an indelible log of transactions that take place between different participants. A ledger records which transaction took place (Participant A has transferred asset X to participant B) and in what order these transactions took place (Participant A transfers asset X to participant B. Subsequently, participant B transfers amount Y of a currency to participant A).
5	0.3381	Transaction data is information about transactions. They usually refer to the time of the transaction, the participants executing or affecting the transaction, and the things or assets to which the transaction relates. A transaction can be considered as a sequence of an exchange of information for a specific purpose (e.g. sale of a bond). The exchange of information is considered a closed unit. Transaction data can be financial, logistical, or production-related in nature and can relate to a purchase, delivery status, hours worked, insurance premium, or claim.
236	0.3334	For the blockchain to undeniably reflect a resume or employment history, the question of who brings the data into each block and who verifies the data is crucial. In some use cases, such as review of financial statements, the answers to these questions are relatively simple. Schools and universities could already make data blocks available to their students in which information on the respective educational path and the achievements achieved are documented. In a blockchain world, the transcripts, certificates, and testimonials would be tamper-proof and basically signed by the issuing institution.
69	0.3332	Transaction history management. Because the transaction data contains all the information about the account that hands over ownership, the account that receives the property, as well as the item and amount to be transferred, ownership information can be reconstructed for each account as long as the entire transaction history is available. As a result, the entire history of all transaction data is sufficient to document ownership
22	0.3207	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
101	0.3046	There are two general ways to use the key pair that differ in the direction in which the data flows: public to private. private to public. Public to private: Using asymmetric cryptography here is about sending information to the owner of the private key in a secure way. It works because anyone can create text encrypted with the public key, but only the owner of the private key can decrypt that text and read the message.
195	0.3044	Each time a frozen fish box is transferred from Carl’s fisher boat to Bob’s truck, Bob and Carl sign a statement agreeing the change of custody. The same happens when Bob delivers the fish to Alice. At each such transfer, the signed change-of-custody certificate is time stamped, the prior record is hashed, and the current record is appended to the list.
27		Hash-based consensus verifies blockchain integrity.
27	0.6472	After the first block is created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the hash of the previous block to calculate its own hash. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, its authenticity must be verified through a calculation process called validation or consensus. At this point in the blockchain process, much of the nodes on the network must agree and confirm that the hash of the new block has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger use the same state.
174	0.6286	Solving this puzzle is intentionally time-consuming. Insisting on solving the hash puzzle is one way to make the manipulation of the transaction history unjustifiably complex. Unfortunately, this security measure is accompanied by a reduced processing speed and thus a limited scalability. This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
44	0.6191	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
49	0.6188	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
215	0.5944	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
173	0.5818	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
166	0.5802	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
61	0.5800	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
50	0.5771	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.
159	0.5650	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
28		Immutable blocks maintain blockchain integrity.
49	0.5697	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.

Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
56	0.5378	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
43	0.5313	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
173	0.5051	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.

Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger use the same state.
154	0.4907	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
215	0.4884	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
164	0.4860	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus. Permissionless or public blockchains offer a platform for new business models. However, by definition, they are based on a very computationally intensive computational model to ensure transaction integrity.
64	0.4790	Design of ledgers for distributed and untrusted environments. The best way to prevent the transaction history from being changed is to make it immutable. This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.
19	0.4766	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
29		Cryprocurrencies - in a few words
222	0.3610	Settlement of fees and levies. Termination and change of supplier. Over-the-counter electricity wholesale. P2P trading between customers of an electricity supplier. Trading and allocation of network capacities. Tenant electricity (optimization of local resources). Shared investments in the case of external tenant electricity (partial) coverage of the residual electricity purchase by purchasing external energy capacity)
29	0.2937	A cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchange that uses encryption to secure the processes implemented in generating money and conducting money transactions. Cryptocurrencies are a subset of digital currencies and therefore have no physical representation. You can't put them in your wallet. They can be used for digital transactions with all business partners who accept them. Transactions with cryptocurrencies are usually carried out through mobile payment from a digital wallet. There are numerous cryptocurrencies around the world. Among them, Bitcoin is the most prominent example.
209	0.2862	Smart contracts can enable microtransactions for different types of billing. For example, they could be used in a digital wallet to control expenses: you can give your son €20 in the digital wallet with the condition that the money cannot be spent on fast food and on cinema tickets only if the screening does not take place in the afternoon, when he should actually do his homework.
60	0.2714	Only one of them should be the new and rightful owner. Therefore, the situation is called the problem of double spending. In the context of copying digital goods, the problem of double spending refers to the fact that data can be copied on a computer without significant restrictions. Copying a representation of a unique real object (house, money, cars, etc.) is the digital equivalent of counterfeiting banknotes with a photocopier.
200	0.2693	Suppose Bob owns a coupon, and decides to transfer half of it Carl, and keep the other half for himself. Bob and Carl each generate a pair of private and public keys. Bob creates a new ledger entry with his current public key, his new public key, and Carl’s public key, saying “I, the owner of the private key matching the first public key, do hereby transfer ownership of the corresponding coupon of the owners of the private keys matching the next two public keys.” Spending one of Alice’s cryptocoupons is like breaking a 20€ bill into two 10€ bills: the old coupon is consumed and replaced by two distinct coupons of smaller value.
221	0.2648	Another system in the energy sector is currently being promoted by the German Energy Agency(dena). In 2019, she developed various use cases for blockchain applications for the energy sector: Congestion management in electricity distribution networks (e-mobility). Energy services for buildings & industrial processes (maintenance). Registration of attachments in the market master data register (MaStR). Certification of guarantees of origin (traceability of the origin of the energy for customers)
31	0.2645	Due to the positioning of Bitcoin outside the control of state and financial authorities and its potential for abuse as an instrument of fraud, money laundering and other illegal activities, as well as other concerns such as its volatility and the unregulated nature of the exchanges on which Bitcoin is traded, cryptocurrencies are viewed with particular skepticism and concern. This image often rubs off on blockchain technology in general.
30	0.2627	In fact, other cryptocurrencies are sometimes referred to as altcoins, alternatives toBitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol enables P2P exchanges in a decentralized system that, unlike traditional currencies, is not associated with a financial institution or government. Bitcoin-to-Bitcoin transactions are made via anonymous, strongly encrypted hash codes on a peer-to-peer network. Each user's digital wallet contains their bitcoins. The wallet also stores all the addresses to which the user sends bitcoin and from which he receives bitcoins, along with a private key known only to the user. The P2P network monitors and verifies the Bitcoin transfers.
210	0.2561	Further application sketches can result from the following parameters: People in Third World countries that do not have an established banking system can participate in the economy with the help of Bitcoin. Protection of copyrights. Development of a sharing economy based on sharing and exchanging goods and services. Improvement of international transfers, which can be made faster and cheaper. Reduce the cost of executing and verifying transactions.
1	0.2535	There are many misleading stories about blockchain. Much of the stories are about cryptocurrencies that led to incredible wealth or nightmare losses, or form the basis for a new financial system that supports dark markets for weapons or drugs. Blockchain is also considered a technology with enormous energy requirements. The variety of design and application possibilities of this technology and the opportunities thvat result from it are omitted from these stories.

206	0.4264	General design aspects. Blockchain technology was initially taken up by the financial industry. Above all, however, new players were pushing into the market. It was also the intention of Bitcoin to establish an alternative to existing processes in banking. Banks carry out intensive account reconciliations for transfers, which are triggered in batch mode at the end of the day. Therefore, a transfer from one customer to another a few days and longer if it is an international transfer. In addition, absurdly high fees are sometimes charged, especially for international money transfers.
129	0.4157	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.

Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.
126	0.3950	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.

39	0.4872	Experts cite several important benefits for using blockchain. Security is considered one of the main advantages of this technology. It is almost impossible to manipulate a blockchain because information from thousands, even millions of computers, is shared and constantly compared with each other. In addition, blockchain does not have a singular point of failure. If one node fails, this is not a problem because all other nodes have a copy of the ledger. Whether blockchain will revolutionize the way public administration, institutions and industries work is an open question.
40	0.4818	Articles in the press have questioned whether blockchain technologies, as they exist now, are sufficiently reliable to deploy on a large scale. Topics include the lack of regulations for this new form of exchange and safety concerns. Blockchains are usually associated with digital currencies such as Bitcoin or alternative versions. However, the fact is that blockchain applications are being researched in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all kinds.
32		Public or private blockchain

Distinguishing between a public blockchain system (without access permissions) and a private (permissoned) blockchain system (with access authorization), where participants have reliable identities and only verified members of the network can participate, is crucial to designing a blockchain application. Private blockchains are better suited for business applications, especially in regulated industries, such as the financial or energy sectors. They are based on customer knowledge and regulatory requirements. The lack of complicated PoW makes private blockchains less energy-intensive.
163	0.6172	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
43	0.5921	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
184	0.5856	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
46	0.5776	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
181	0.5769	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
32	0.5765	Blockchain platforms can be designed either as a public blockchain (without access authorization, permissionless) or private blockchain (with explicit access authorization, permissioned). In a public, permissionless blockchain like Bitcoin, any node on the network (without prior authentication) can transact and participate in the consensus process. In a private blockchain with access authorization, any node can execute transactions, but participation in the consensus process is limited to a limited number of verified nodes.
170	0.5736	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.
94	0.5706	The blockchain must uniquely identify participants and assets and ensure that only the rightful owner can access their property. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system that is open to all. Anyone can connect and provision computing resources or send new transaction data to the system. However, it is not desirable for everyone to access the asset that is assigned to the account managed by the blockchain. An essential feature of private property is its exclusivity. The right to transfer ownership to another account is limited to the owner of the account who hands over ownership.
157	0.5487	The smart contract is the essential core of a blockchain. It determines which actors are involved in which transactions and how, and regulates how the transfer of property, information, etc. takes place. This chapter explains some design parameters that should be considered when developing blockchain applications (public versus private blockchain, transparency versus privacy, and a few more). A small case study explains the design of a blockchain application. Application examples and design sketches show how this still young technology is currently being implemented in practice and which application perspectives already exist.
33		Consensus and validation in the blockchain
27	0.6410	After the first block is created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the hash of the previous block to calculate its own hash. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, its authenticity must be verified through a calculation process called validation or consensus. At this point in the blockchain process, much of the nodes on the network must agree and confirm that the hash of the new block has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger use the same state.
126	0.6331	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
159	0.6296	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
44	0.6218	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
166	0.6096	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
49	0.5967	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
158	0.5930	A blockchain is a distributed, shared, and digital ledger that records the timing of validated facts. These facts can refer to tangible and intangible objects, to money or simply to information. As part of this digital system of recording, each transaction and its details are validated and then recorded in a network of computers. Anyone who has access to the distributed ledger can view this information. All actors on the network agree on the accuracy of the transaction data before the block is replicated, shared, and synchronized between the distributed locations.
65	0.5882	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
215	0.5748	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
25	0.5745	Transaction: Two parties decide to exchange a thing (property, certificate, etc.). Block: The transaction is packaged with other pending transactions creating a „block“. The block is sent to the blockchain network of participating computers.  Verification: The participating computers (called “miners” in the Bitcoin world) determine whether the transactions are valid. If a majority of computers declare the transactions valid, they are considered valid and a “consensus” among the participants has been reached. Blockchain and its processes (continued) Hash: Each verified block of transactions is time-stamped with a cryptographic hash. Each block holds a reference to the previous block’s hash value. This results in a chain of blocks that can hardly be tampered. Execution: The unit of value moves from the account of one party to the account of the other party.
34		Diverse industries explore blockchain applications
34	0.7319	The areas of application are manifold and can certainly not be described conclusively here. Much of the early interest in blockchain technology arose around its application in financial transactions. This is understandable when you consider that the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been used worldwide, proving that blockchain technology can actually work. Banks and other financially relevant institutions have also become early innovators in this area. Other industries, including healthcare, the public sector, agriculture, energy, and many more, are exploring how they can use blockchain to enable the secure exchange of data such as personal health information, digital assets, or real estate data.
1	0.6411	There are many misleading stories about blockchain. Much of the stories are about cryptocurrencies that led to incredible wealth or nightmare losses, or form the basis for a new financial system that supports dark markets for weapons or drugs. Blockchain is also considered a technology with enormous energy requirements. The variety of design and application possibilities of this technology and the opportunities thvat result from it are omitted from these stories.
35	0.6282	Manufacturing companies and other similar companies also see some potential to use blockchain to manage smart contracts and track materials as they move through their supply chains. Experts believe that blockchain can be used in tax collection, asset transfers, distribution of social benefits, and even voting procedures such as elections. Blockchain can also be used to exchange legal and similar documents such as certificates, testimonials and proofs.
40	0.6071	Articles in the press have questioned whether blockchain technologies, as they exist now, are sufficiently reliable to deploy on a large scale. Topics include the lack of regulations for this new form of exchange and safety concerns. Blockchains are usually associated with digital currencies such as Bitcoin or alternative versions. However, the fact is that blockchain applications are being researched in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all kinds.
42	0.5870	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
240	0.5857	While most experts agree that blockchain will eventually be used by human resources for hiring and administrative purposes, the use of blockchains is not yet in sight here. In contrast to financial applications, recruitment, CVs or job histories do not yet have use cases that credibly demonstrate trustworthy use in the management of histories. This means that the use of blockchain technology will initially be limited to the review and documentation of education and training.
207	0.5770	With a blockchain in which all financial actors are involved, a money transfer can be executed in seconds, at almost disappearing transaction costs. However, there are other sectors that are also using blockchain in the meantime, such as healthcare, energy, human resources, real estate trading, education and others. A variety of industries could benefit from the use of smart contracts that control supply chains and record the corresponding transactions on a blockchain.
216	0.5729	Application examples and sketches. Blockchain and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Blockchain, the technology that made Bitcoin possible, has received a lot of attention in the IoT world, often because of its role in privacy and security. The potential of blockchain for IoT is greater than just keeping evil actors in the network at bay. Smart contracts in blockchains, for example, can take over the activation of authentication of devices, especially if they are rarely connected, as could be the case, with systems in agriculture that are shut down for large parts of the year.
39	0.5651	Experts cite several important benefits for using blockchain. Security is considered one of the main advantages of this technology. It is almost impossible to manipulate a blockchain because information from thousands, even millions of computers, is shared and constantly compared with each other. In addition, blockchain does not have a singular point of failure. If one node fails, this is not a problem because all other nodes have a copy of the ledger. Whether blockchain will revolutionize the way public administration, institutions and industries work is an open question.
37	0.5651	For a company, blockchain offers the following basic possibilities: A design approach that keeps transaction data, value, and status inherently close to business logic. The necessary data schemas for transactional data are easier to manage. Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.

238	0.6178	Blockchains could be helpful in making educational information more transparent and making it accessible to businesses and organizations that might need that information in the future. In addition, a blockchain could also track an employee from job to job and provide that employee with a fast and reliable means to have education and work records at hand and forward faster. The trusted security of the blockchain can additionally help employers and employees when it comes to international recruiting, where it becomes necessary to apply for the right work permits and realize secure payments abroad.
36	0.6130	Some believe that individuals can use this technology to have better control over personal information and then selectively share parts of their data when necessary; Use cases here include individual medical records and corporate supply chains. In addition, proponents also say blockchains can help better track intellectual property rights and property for art, assets, music, film, and more. Blockchain offers a radically different approach. It firmly manifests the feasibility of peer-to-peer communication over the Internet without the need for a trusted intermediary.

An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
8	0.4001	There are carefully monitored and closed systems in which only privileged users are allowed to make entries. For example, when a customer transfers money from one bank account to another, they ask the bank to do so on their behalf instead of dealing directly with the bank's transaction system. Centralization is associated with the paradigm of central control. This has other implications. A central system is a system that, by definition, has a critical source of failure. It also implies a concentration of power when some privileged users have the prerogative to manipulate transactions, for example, for unilaterally canceling a transaction or charging fees.
201	0.3776	Next, Alice must decide how to manage her blockchain. As she does not want to do it herself, she will crowdsource blockchain management by offering additional coupons as a fee to anyone who volunteers to be a miner, that is, to do the work of running a consensus protocol. She sets up a peer-to-peer network (also called gossip network) to allow coupon aficionados to share data.
19	0.3718	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
177	0.3674	The remaining group of actors forms an oligopoly that divides responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the system among themselves. Much like oligopolies in other industries, this small group of actors could abuse their power. This effect creates a kind of hidden centrality that undermines the distributed nature of the entire system. From a technical point of view, such a system is still a distributed system, but it is a system whose integrity is maintained only by a small number of actors.
14	0.3630	This requires the presence of acommunication protocol, as well as the sending, receiving, and processing of messages.  Security issues: Sending data over a network implies security concerns, as untrusted users may misuse the network to access and use data without authorization. The less restricted access to the network over which the distributed nodes communicate, the higher the security concerns for the distributed system. Decentralized communication with equal nodes.

168	0.3532	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
228	0.3520	The advantage of a blockchain solution lies in the creation of a uniform information on the status of asylum procedures that crosses the organization. This level of information is visible, comprehensible and cannot be manipulated by all authorities involved and forms the basis for improving process integrity. Smart contracts can also support the management of these processes and enable the establishment of an inter-agency process management system in the future. In addition, a blockchain solution can support decentralized data storage and thus contribute in particular to the data sovereignty of the individual authorities.

179	0.5034	Critical size. The robustness against manipulation and thus the trustworthiness of the collectively maintained transaction data history is based on the assumption that the majority of the computing power of the system is controlled by honest actors. However, in small peer-to-peer systems with limited computing power, this majority can still be very small, which in turn could allow a 51 percent attack to be carried out.
164	0.4965	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus.

188	0.3907	Decision on transparency vs. data protection. When you make a decision about the conflict between transparency and privacy, you need to decide who you want to give read access to. If only extreme cases where read access is granted are considered, there are two options: grant read access to everyone or grant read access to only a limited group of actors. · Public blockchains grant all actors read access and the right to create new transactions. · Private blockchains restrict read access and the right to record new transactions to a select group of actors.

163	0.5300	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.

Blockchain can support the growth and development of IoT, including fraud management, identity management, authentication, authorization, billing, and audits. The sheer volume dimension of IoT creates new management problems that existing systems have not yet faced. Automating many, if not all, aspects of operations will be crucial, and blockchain is well positioned to take on critical roles here.

A blockchain-based system was designed by a mixed team of science and practice. In addition to the advantages of the blockchain mentioned here, the immutability and transparency of the data in particular pose major challenges with regard to data protection. This is particularly important in the asylum process, in which extremely sensitive data must be stored and processed. The consideration of legal aspects is naturally in the foreground of such a project.

159	0.5901	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data.

51	0.5208	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
50	0.5200	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.
154	0.5144	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.

On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
183	0.5825	Lack of user acceptance. Blockchain faces two conflicts: Transparency vs. data protection and Security vs. Speed
39	0.5795	Experts cite several important benefits for using blockchain. Security is considered one of the main advantages of this technology. It is almost impossible to manipulate a blockchain because information from thousands, even millions of computers, is shared and constantly compared with each other. In addition, blockchain does not have a singular point of failure. If one node fails, this is not a problem because all other nodes have a copy of the ledger. Whether blockchain will revolutionize the way public administration, institutions and industries work is an open question.
173	0.5781	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
37	0.5715	For a company, blockchain offers the following basic possibilities: A design approach that keeps transaction data, value, and status inherently close to business logic. The necessary data schemas for transactional data are easier to manage. Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.

181	0.5542	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
215	0.5494	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
36	0.5465	Some believe that individuals can use this technology to have better control over personal information and then selectively share parts of their data when necessary; Use cases here include individual medical records and corporate supply chains. In addition, proponents also say blockchains can help better track intellectual property rights and property for art, assets, music, film, and more. Blockchain offers a radically different approach. It firmly manifests the feasibility of peer-to-peer communication over the Internet without the need for a trusted intermediary.

Protection of copyrights. Development of a sharing economy based on sharing and exchanging goods and services. Improvement of international transfers, which can be made faster and cheaper. Reduce the cost of executing and verifying transactions.
206	0.5042	General design aspects. Blockchain technology was initially taken up by the financial industry. Above all, however, new players were pushing into the market. It was also the intention of Bitcoin to establish an alternative to existing processes in banking. Banks carry out intensive account reconciliations for transfers, which are triggered in batch mode at the end of the day. Therefore, a transfer from one customer to another a few days and longer if it is an international transfer. In addition, absurdly high fees are sometimes charged, especially for international money transfers.

22	0.5744	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.

197	0.5535	At every stage, Alice’s supply-chain blockchain includes identities and access control. The temperature sensors sign their votes, so voter fraud is impossible. Only Alice, Bob, Carl, and the sensors have permission to write to the record list, so it is possible to hold participants accountable if someone tries to tamper with the ledger. In this distributed data storage, a linked list serves as a ledger and a combination of fault-tolerant Byzantine votes and human signatures serves as a consensus. The principle of ledger plus consensus is essential in blockchains.
65	0.5498	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
27	0.5449	After the first block is created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the hash of the previous block to calculate its own hash. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, its authenticity must be verified through a calculation process called validation or consensus. At this point in the blockchain process, much of the nodes on the network must agree and confirm that the hash of the new block has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger use the same state.
166	0.5408	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
126	0.5291	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
45		The Ledger
22	0.6022	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
47	0.5879	The concept of the ledger has its origins in double-entry bookkeeping, where each posting on one account requires a corresponding and opposite posting on another account. This helps to detect errors. In the context of blockchain, a ledger is an indelible log of transactions that take place between different participants. A ledger records which transaction took place (Participant A has transferred asset X to participant B) and in what order these transactions took place (Participant A transfers asset X to participant B. Subsequently, participant B transfers amount Y of a currency to participant A).
48	0.5708	The ledgers are accessible to all participants registered on a particular network (private blockchain), or to the public as a whole (public blockchain). Ledgers are tamper-proof:  no participant can add, delete or change ledger entries once saved. The management of the ledger must be immune to attacks to ensure that the ledger remains secure even if some participants inadvertently or intentionally behave maliciously.
45	0.5703	This chapter describes the central element of blockchain technology: the ledger or, to German, the ledger. It explains the architecture of the ledger and the functions and mechanisms for the forgery-proof storage of transaction data.
21	0.5640	Ledgers or account books have been around for a long, long time. In the past, of course, they were only available in paper form. With increasing digitalization, the account books are managed digitally. Traditionally, a central authority has been responsible and responsible for validating ledger entries. For example, banks are required to review financial transactions. However, the original form of the ledger still serves as a metaphor for the secure storage of transaction data. Computerized ledgers usually mirror what once existed on paper.
64	0.5225	Design of ledgers for distributed and untrusted environments. The best way to prevent the transaction history from being changed is to make it immutable. This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.
26	0.4748	A blockchain ledger consists of two types of records, individual transactions and blocks. The first block consists of a header and data related to transactions that take place within a specified period of time. The block's timestamp is used to create an alphanumeric string called a hash (a type of unique fingerprint of the transaction).
65	0.4730	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
4	0.4687	A blockchain is initially a chain of blocks. These blocks, in which transactions are stored, are linked together. The storage location is the so-called ledger (account book or journal, which is known from accounting). Blockchains are stored decentrally in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. A ledger is therefore a kind of distributed account book for the permanent and tamper-proof storage of transaction data. Each computer on the distributed P2P network maintains a copy of this account book to avoid a single point of failure (SPOF). All copies of the blockchain are updated and validated at the same time.
44	0.4576	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
46		Blockchain: Cryptographic proof and user anonymity.
46	0.6730	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
163	0.5790	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
42	0.5599	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
103	0.5594	The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to achieve two goals: Identify accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys. Authorize transactions: The owner of the account that hands over ownership creates an encrypted text with the corresponding private key. This encrypted text can be validated using the appropriate public key. This is the number of the account that hands over ownership.
43	0.5518	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control.

170	0.5484	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.
184	0.5413	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.

A blockchain-based system was designed by a mixed team of science and practice. In addition to the advantages of the blockchain mentioned here, the immutability and transparency of the data in particular pose major challenges with regard to data protection. This is particularly important in the asylum process, in which extremely sensitive data must be stored and processed. The consideration of legal aspects is naturally in the foreground of such a project.
162	0.5328	Public versus private blockchain. Distinguishing between a public blockchain system (without access permissions) and a private (permissoned) blockchain system (with access authorization), where participants have reliable identities and only verified members of the network can participate, is crucial to designing a blockchain application. Private blockchains are better suited for business applications, especially in regulated industries, such as the financial or energy sectors. They are based on customer knowledge and regulatory requirements. The lack of complicated PoW makes private blockchains less energy-intensive.
47		Blockchain ledger: Immutable transaction log.
43	0.6141	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.

This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.
45	0.5825	This chapter describes the central element of blockchain technology: the ledger or, to German, the ledger. It explains the architecture of the ledger and the functions and mechanisms for the forgery-proof storage of transaction data.
129	0.5812	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
47	0.5791	The concept of the ledger has its origins in double-entry bookkeeping, where each posting on one account requires a corresponding and opposite posting on another account. This helps to detect errors. In the context of blockchain, a ledger is an indelible log of transactions that take place between different participants. A ledger records which transaction took place (Participant A has transferred asset X to participant B) and in what order these transactions took place (Participant A transfers asset X to participant B. Subsequently, participant B transfers amount Y of a currency to participant A).
233	0.5532	Paper-based systems tend to be less suitable for tracking. The blockchain's immutable, robust records, secure mapping at the time of creation, and the use of smart contracts can make monitoring customs border trade more efficient and transparent. Information about goods such as customs declarations, proof of origin and purchase or loading lists can become part of an accessible block for suppliers, transporters, buyers, regulators and auditors. Increased transparency of the use of blockchain in traceability leads to lower transaction, audit and accounting costs.
42	0.5416	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
189	0.5241	The exact temporal assignment (time stamp) and the immutability of the transaction data is an important aspect of blockchains. Once stored, data can no longer be changed. This can be a problem if the General Data Protection Regulation gives users the right to be forgotten and all of a user's personal data must be deleted. Any design of a blockchain that is contrary to legal regulations is automatically doomed to failure. In the present case, it makes sense to separate the personal data from the actual transaction data via a link.
154	0.5211	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
48		Immutable and secure ledgers for all participants.

48	0.6590	The ledgers are accessible to all participants registered on a particular network (private blockchain), or to the public as a whole (public blockchain). Ledgers are tamper-proof:  no participant can add, delete or change ledger entries once saved. The management of the ledger must be immune to attacks to ensure that the ledger remains secure even if some participants inadvertently or intentionally behave maliciously.

197	0.5585	At every stage, Alice’s supply-chain blockchain includes identities and access control. The temperature sensors sign their votes, so voter fraud is impossible. Only Alice, Bob, Carl, and the sensors have permission to write to the record list, so it is possible to hold participants accountable if someone tries to tamper with the ledger. In this distributed data storage, a linked list serves as a ledger and a combination of fault-tolerant Byzantine votes and human signatures serves as a consensus. The principle of ledger plus consensus is essential in blockchains.
163	0.5520	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
21	0.5494	Ledgers or account books have been around for a long, long time. In the past, of course, they were only available in paper form. With increasing digitalization, the account books are managed digitally. Traditionally, a central authority has been responsible and responsible for validating ledger entries. For example, banks are required to review financial transactions. However, the original form of the ledger still serves as a metaphor for the secure storage of transaction data. Computerized ledgers usually mirror what once existed on paper.

49		Blockchain: Integrity and trust reinforcement.
49	0.7324	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
51	0.6699	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
56	0.6365	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
50	0.6147	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.
126	0.6075	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
61	0.6042	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
159	0.6042	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
65	0.6030	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
215	0.5959	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
164	0.5821	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus. Permissionless or public blockchains offer a platform for new business models. However, by definition, they are based on a very computationally intensive computational model to ensure transaction integrity.

However, in small peer-to-peer systems with limited computing power, this majority can still be very small, which in turn could allow a 51 percent attack to be carried out.
51	0.4449	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
14	0.4261	This requires the presence of acommunication protocol, as well as the sending, receiving, and processing of messages.  Security issues: Sending data over a network implies security concerns, as untrusted users may misuse the network to access and use data without authorization. The less restricted access to the network over which the distributed nodes communicate, the higher the security concerns for the distributed system. Decentralized communication with equal nodes.

The need to solve a puzzle for each block added to the blockchain data structure, and the rules for distributing rewards that contribute to the integrity of the system, lead to an arms race between actors in terms of their computing power. The supposedly large and democratic group of actors who together maintain the integrity of the system eventually become a very small group of actors who have enormous computing power, often in the form of specialized hardware.
50	0.4004	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.
156	0.3985	However, it is impossible for any attacker who has less computing power than the majority to take a new path, catching up with and overtaking the path taken by the majority. Therefore, any attempt to set up a new authorized path that contains fraudulent transactions will be overtaken and rejected by the path maintained by the honest majority. As a result, the history of transactions managed by the system is robust against manipulation.
55		The Byzantine Generals Problem: Consensus in the Face of Betrayal
52	0.6966	The problem of achieving and maintaining integrity and trust in a system consisting of an unknown number of members with unknown trustworthiness is well known and widely used in computer science. It is called the problem of Byzantine generals.
55	0.6020	In the siege of a city, several generals have a communication problem. Because of the strong fortification, it is necessary for the generals with their troops to attack the city simultaneously from different directions. The generals can communicate with each other via messengers. However, some of the generals intrigue against others. Their goal is to discredit their competitors – for example, by trying to drive the others to a premature attack through cleverly spread misinformation. None of the generals now know what information is authentic and who they can trust. It is therefore a problem of agreement, which consists in the fact that the commanders must decide unanimously whether to attack or not.

54	0.5566	The problem is complicated by the spatial separation of the commanders; so, they have to send messengers back and forth. There is also the possibility that there may be traitors among the generals who can deliberately send misleading information to the other generals. Mathematically, it turned out that the loyal generals only have a chance of reaching an agreement under these conditions if the proportion of the schemers is less than a third. Thus, there was no solution, especially for three generals, one of whom is a schemer – at least not with the help of classical communication methods such as messengers.
166	0.4268	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT.

This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.

56		Blockchain: Revolutionizing Proof of Ownership and Property Management
56	0.6804	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
62	0.6332	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
182	0.5933	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system. Those who have witnessed the emergence and development of the Internet may see a similarity between the legal status of today's blockchain and the lack of legal acceptance of e-commerce in the nineties.
181	0.5927	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system.

217	0.5842	They can recognize the re-registration of long-standing passive network participants as trusted members. Blockchain can support the growth and development of IoT, including fraud management, identity management, authentication, authorization, billing, and audits. The sheer volume dimension of IoT creates new management problems that existing systems have not yet faced. Automating many, if not all, aspects of operations will be crucial, and blockchain is well positioned to take on critical roles here.
94	0.5657	The blockchain must uniquely identify participants and assets and ensure that only the rightful owner can access their property. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system that is open to all. Anyone can connect and provision computing resources or send new transaction data to the system. However, it is not desirable for everyone to access the asset that is assigned to the account managed by the blockchain. An essential feature of private property is its exclusivity. The right to transfer ownership to another account is limited to the owner of the account who hands over ownership.

In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
184	0.5406	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
36	0.5394	Some believe that individuals can use this technology to have better control over personal information and then selectively share parts of their data when necessary; Use cases here include individual medical records and corporate supply chains. In addition, proponents also say blockchains can help better track intellectual property rights and property for art, assets, music, film, and more. Blockchain offers a radically different approach. It firmly manifests the feasibility of peer-to-peer communication over the Internet without the need for a trusted intermediary.
57		Blockchain: Transforming Proof of Ownership and Property Management through Immutable Ledgers

The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
43	0.5879	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
57	0.5848	The assignment between owners and objects is usually done via a general ledger or register. A ledger  is a concrete implementation of an assignment between owners  and property. Proof of ownership requires the identification of owners and property, as well as the assignment between owners and property. The use of the property requires identification as well as authentication and authorization to ensure that only the legitimate person  legally owns the property.

64	0.5434	Design of ledgers for distributed and untrusted environments. The best way to prevent the transaction history from being changed is to make it immutable. This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.

111	0.5277	By signing and verifying transactions, the transfer of ownership in blockchain is authorized.
58		The Three Pillars of Secure Access: Identification, Authentication, and Authorization
58	0.6107	Identification means identifying oneself as a specific person. Authentication means proving that this person is really the one you are working for. Authorization means being able to access something because of the previously authenticated identity.
38	0.5386	Access via access authorization as an alternative to uncontrolled access without authorization check, which may meet existing regulations in the company.
42	0.4658	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements.

46	0.4652	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
56	0.4477	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
103	0.4454	The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to achieve two goals: Identify accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys. Authorize transactions: The owner of the account that hands over ownership creates an encrypted text with the corresponding private key. This encrypted text can be validated using the appropriate public key. This is the number of the account that hands over ownership.
171	0.4318	The Security Model. The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to identify and authenticate actors and authorize transactions. Account numbers on the blockchain are actually public cryptographic keys. Only the person who has the appropriate private key can access the property associated with an account. Only transaction data that contains a digital signature created with the appropriate private key is valid and can transfer ownership from one account to another.
172	0.4302	The private key is the only security tool that authorizes the rightful owner. Once an account's private key is intentionally, accidentally, or leaked to another user due to data theft, the security of that single account is no longer guaranteed. There are no additional security measures in place to protect the property associated with an account number.
185	0.4299	However, this approach is contrary to the concept of privacy. Privacy means that transactional data, or details of how the accounts involved or the amount transferred, should remain hidden from the public. The resulting conflict consists, on the one hand, in the transparency required to clarify ownership and, on the other hand, in the higher data protection requirements of users.
104	0.4215	The blockchain must ensure that only the owner of one account can transfer the associated asset to other accounts. The transfer of ownership is based on a digital security measure corresponding to the handwritten signature and serves the same purpose: Identify an account, Instruction of the owner, which relating to the content of the corresponding transaction and Approval of the execution by adding the data to its transaction history.
59		Double Spending and the Challenge of Consistency in Distributed Peer-to-Peer Systems
59	0.7006	Double spending is one of the most important examples of integrity breaches in distributed peer-to-peer systems. After transferring ownership from one person to another, all ledgers of the system must be updated so that the latest version reflects the new reality.  However, sharing information between members in the blockchain system and updating individual ledgers will take time. Some members already know about the last transfer of ownership, while others have not yet received this information. At this point, the system is not consistent.  
61	0.6820	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
15	0.6677	Peer-to-peer systems are a special kind of distributed systems. They consist of individual. computers that make their computing resources directly available to all other members of the network without a central coordination point. When joining a peer-to-peer system, users turn their computers into node computers of the system that are the same in terms of their rights and roles. All nodes in the system have the same functionality and responsibility. All users' computers are both providers and consumers of resources.
16	0.6575	A peer-to-peer network is a decentralized communication model in which each node on the network has the same capabilities and can establish communication with all other nodes. Unlike the client-server model, where the client sends a request to a server that is implemented by it, in the P2P network each node can assume the role of client or server. P2P systems can be used to provide anonymized routing of data traffic, parallel computing environments, distributed data storage and other functions. P2P has historically gained notoriety through the sharing of movies, music, digital books and other media.

P2P has historically gained notoriety through the sharing of movies, music, digital books and other media. It is, therefore, often associated with software piracy and copyright infringement.
44	0.5432	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
60		The Problem of Double Spending: Counterfeiting in the Digital Realm
60	0.7129	Only one of them should be the new and rightful owner. Therefore, the situation is called the problem of double spending. In the context of copying digital goods, the problem of double spending refers to the fact that data can be copied on a computer without significant restrictions. Copying a representation of a unique real object (house, money, cars, etc.) is the digital equivalent of counterfeiting banknotes with a photocopier.

With increasing digitalization, the account books are managed digitally. Traditionally, a central authority has been responsible and responsible for validating ledger entries. For example, banks are required to review financial transactions. However, the original form of the ledger still serves as a metaphor for the secure storage of transaction data. Computerized ledgers usually mirror what once existed on paper.
200	0.4573	Suppose Bob owns a coupon, and decides to transfer half of it Carl, and keep the other half for himself. Bob and Carl each generate a pair of private and public keys. Bob creates a new ledger entry with his current public key, his new public key, and Carl’s public key, saying “I, the owner of the private key matching the first public key, do hereby transfer ownership of the corresponding coupon of the owners of the private keys matching the next two public keys.” Spending one of Alice’s cryptocoupons is like breaking a 20€ bill into two 10€ bills: the old coupon is consumed and replaced by two distinct coupons of smaller value.

115	0.4357	Due to the fact that cryptographic hash values can be considered digital fingerprints, they are unique to each transaction. An essential feature of public-private key cryptography is that encrypted  text created with a key can only be decrypted with its corresponding counterpart.  The assignment of both keys is unique. With this property, digital signatures can serve as proof that the owner of the private key used to create the digital signature actually agrees with the content of the transaction.

In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust.

The right to transfer ownership to another account is limited to the owner of the account who hands over ownership.
65	0.6247	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
59	0.6029	Double spending is one of the most important examples of integrity breaches in distributed peer-to-peer systems. After transferring ownership from one person to another, all ledgers of the system must be updated so that the latest version reflects the new reality.  However, sharing information between members in the blockchain system and updating individual ledgers will take time. Some members already know about the last transfer of ownership, while others have not yet received this information. At this point, the system is not consistent.  
36	0.5852	Some believe that individuals can use this technology to have better control over personal information and then selectively share parts of their data when necessary; Use cases here include individual medical records and corporate supply chains. In addition, proponents also say blockchains can help better track intellectual property rights and property for art, assets, music, film, and more. Blockchain offers a radically different approach. It firmly manifests the feasibility of peer-to-peer communication over the Internet without the need for a trusted intermediary.
168	0.5848	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
126	0.5732	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
56	0.5695	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
173	0.5672	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
63		Ensuring Property Protection and Secure Transaction Storage in Blockchain Systems
63	0.6466	Property protection has three main elements: identifying and authenticating owners, and restricting access to property to its rightful owners. Storing transaction data. The transaction history is used to clarify ownership. Since transaction history is the core element in the clarification of ownership, it must be stored in a secure manner.
215	0.6174	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
37	0.5867	For a company, blockchain offers the following basic possibilities: A design approach that keeps transaction data, value, and status inherently close to business logic. The necessary data schemas for transactional data are easier to manage. Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.
56	0.5844	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
64	0.5738	Design of ledgers for distributed and untrusted environments. The best way to prevent the transaction history from being changed is to make it immutable. This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.
49	0.5690	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
184	0.5588	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
62	0.5532	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
72	0.5521	Limit the number of transactions per user. Limit the total quantity of items/assets that can be sold in a given period. Enforce that an account retains an item/asset for a minimum period of time before it can be further transferred. Authorization. Only the owner of the account who hands over ownership should be allowed to instruct the blockchain to execute a transaction on their behalf.
182	0.5488	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system. Those who have witnessed the emergence and development of the Internet may see a similarity between the legal status of today's blockchain and the lack of legal acceptance of e-commerce in the nineties.
64		Design Considerations for Immutable and Distributed Ledgers in Untrusted Environments
64	0.7258	Design of ledgers for distributed and untrusted environments. The best way to prevent the transaction history from being changed is to make it immutable. This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.
43	0.6551	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
22	0.5914	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
48	0.5726	The ledgers are accessible to all participants registered on a particular network (private blockchain), or to the public as a whole (public blockchain). Ledgers are tamper-proof:  no participant can add, delete or change ledger entries once saved. The management of the ledger must be immune to attacks to ensure that the ledger remains secure even if some participants inadvertently or intentionally behave maliciously.
61	0.5712	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.

227	0.4925	In 2018, the BAMF decided to evaluate the potential of blockchain technology in the context of asylum as part of a proof-of-concept project. A blockchain-based system was designed by a mixed team of science and practice. In addition to the advantages of the blockchain mentioned here, the immutability and transparency of the data in particular pose major challenges with regard to data protection. This is particularly important in the asylum process, in which extremely sensitive data must be stored and processed. The consideration of legal aspects is naturally in the foreground of such a project.

Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
166	0.5796	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
159	0.5597	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
44	0.5540	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
27	0.5494	After the first block is created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the hash of the previous block to calculate its own hash. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, its authenticity must be verified through a calculation process called validation or consensus. At this point in the blockchain process, much of the nodes on the network must agree and confirm that the hash of the new block has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger use the same state.
197	0.5444	At every stage, Alice’s supply-chain blockchain includes identities and access control. The temperature sensors sign their votes, so voter fraud is impossible. Only Alice, Bob, Carl, and the sensors have permission to write to the record list, so it is possible to hold participants accountable if someone tries to tamper with the ledger. In this distributed data storage, a linked list serves as a ledger and a combination of fault-tolerant Byzantine votes and human signatures serves as a consensus. The principle of ledger plus consensus is essential in blockchains.
215	0.5397	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain.

66		Ensuring Transparency and Traceability: Documenting Property Transfer and History
66	0.6617	The aim is a transparent and comprehensible documentation of the property. This includes the following aspects: Description of the transfer of ownership. Maintaining transfer history
69	0.5322	Transaction history management. Because the transaction data contains all the information about the account that hands over ownership, the account that receives the property, as well as the item and amount to be transferred, ownership information can be reconstructed for each account as long as the entire transaction history is available. As a result, the entire history of all transaction data is sufficient to document ownership
233	0.4938	Paper-based systems tend to be less suitable for tracking. The blockchain's immutable, robust records, secure mapping at the time of creation, and the use of smart contracts can make monitoring customs border trade more efficient and transparent. Information about goods such as customs declarations, proof of origin and purchase or loading lists can become part of an accessible block for suppliers, transporters, buyers, regulators and auditors. Increased transparency of the use of blockchain in traceability leads to lower transaction, audit and accounting costs.

187	0.4594	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.
70	0.4520	The complete history of transaction data is a process chain that provides information about how people acquired and transferred ownership. Any transaction that is not part of this history is considered as if it never happened. A transaction is executed by adding it to the history of the transaction data. The order in which transaction data is added to the history must be preserved. Only transaction data that meets the following three criteria are added to the Blockchain: Formal correctness. Semantic correctness. Authorization
185	0.4480	However, this approach is contrary to the concept of privacy. Privacy means that transactional data, or details of how the accounts involved or the amount transferred, should remain hidden from the public.

Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
116	0.4902	The challenge is to store all transaction data that has ever taken place in such a way that the order in which the transactions took place is preserved and changes to the data are detected quickly and easily. The rapid detection of changes is important to prevent manipulation of the transaction history.
104	0.4881	The blockchain must ensure that only the owner of one account can transfer the associated asset to other accounts. The transfer of ownership is based on a digital security measure corresponding to the handwritten signature and serves the same purpose: Identify an account, Instruction of the owner, which relating to the content of the corresponding transaction and Approval of the execution by adding the data to its transaction history.
71		Ensuring Correctness: Formal and Semantic Criteria in Transaction Processing
71	0.7253	Formal correctness: The description of a transaction contains all the necessary data and this data is provided in the correct format. Semantic correctness: It focuses on the statement of transaction data and its intended effect. Semantic correctness is often based on business rules, for example: Ensure that no more is spent from the account than allow balance and line of credit. Avoidance of double spending. Limit the number of items/assets that can be transferred in a single transaction.
187	0.5806	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.
127	0.5618	Whether a transaction is valid is therefore decided by the majority of actors. However, not all actors are asked for their opinions. The consensus should be reached automatically. There are several mechanisms for designing and implementing an automated consensus. In principle, any actor can propose a transaction that is posted to the ledger. At a certain point in time, however, only one transaction is selected for posting. All honest actors agree on which transaction was selected (agreement), all honest participants finally learn which was the selected transaction (closing) and that the selected transaction was considered valid (validity).
116	0.5151	The challenge is to store all transaction data that has ever taken place in such a way that the order in which the transactions took place is preserved and changes to the data are detected quickly and easily. The rapid detection of changes is important to prevent manipulation of the transaction history.
134	0.5116	Therefore, the idea arose to define a protocol for determining the valid transaction sequence based on the computational effort. Two criteria can be used for this: The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the heaviest chain
70	0.4942	The complete history of transaction data is a process chain that provides information about how people acquired and transferred ownership. Any transaction that is not part of this history is considered as if it never happened. A transaction is executed by adding it to the history of the transaction data. The order in which transaction data is added to the history must be preserved. Only transaction data that meets the following three criteria are added to the Blockchain: Formal correctness. Semantic correctness. Authorization
5	0.4650	Transaction data is information about transactions. They usually refer to the time of the transaction, the participants executing or affecting the transaction, and the things or assets to which the transaction relates. A transaction can be considered as a sequence of an exchange of information for a specific purpose (e.g. sale of a bond). The exchange of information is considered a closed unit. Transaction data can be financial, logistical, or production-related in nature and can relate to a purchase, delivery status, hours worked, insurance premium, or claim.
25	0.4602	Transaction: Two parties decide to exchange a thing (property, certificate, etc.). Block: The transaction is packaged with other pending transactions creating a „block“. The block is sent to the blockchain network of participating computers.  Verification: The participating computers (called “miners” in the Bitcoin world) determine whether the transactions are valid. If a majority of computers declare the transactions valid, they are considered valid and a “consensus” among the participants has been reached. Blockchain and its processes (continued) Hash: Each verified block of transactions is time-stamped with a cryptographic hash. Each block holds a reference to the previous block’s hash value. This results in a chain of blocks that can hardly be tampered. Execution: The unit of value moves from the account of one party to the account of the other party.
37	0.4386	For a company, blockchain offers the following basic possibilities: A design approach that keeps transaction data, value, and status inherently close to business logic. The necessary data schemas for transactional data are easier to manage. Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.
215	0.4332	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
72		Enforcing Transaction Limits and Authorization in Blockchain Systems
72	0.7405	Limit the number of transactions per user. Limit the total quantity of items/assets that can be sold in a given period. Enforce that an account retains an item/asset for a minimum period of time before it can be further transferred. Authorization. Only the owner of the account who hands over ownership should be allowed to instruct the blockchain to execute a transaction on their behalf.
166	0.6136	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
65	0.5723	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
215	0.5486	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain.

Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
156	0.5441	However, it is impossible for any attacker who has less computing power than the majority to take a new path, catching up with and overtaking the path taken by the majority. Therefore, any attempt to set up a new authorized path that contains fraudulent transactions will be overtaken and rejected by the path maintained by the honest majority. As a result, the history of transactions managed by the system is robust against manipulation.
164	0.5437	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus. Permissionless or public blockchains offer a platform for new business models. However, by definition, they are based on a very computationally intensive computational model to ensure transaction integrity.
37	0.5381	For a company, blockchain offers the following basic possibilities: A design approach that keeps transaction data, value, and status inherently close to business logic. The necessary data schemas for transactional data are easier to manage. Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.
173	0.5375	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
154	0.5351	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
42	0.5336	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.

73	0.5850	In the Blockchain, it is necessary to identify transaction data and possibly any kind of data too unambiguously. This is done with the help of a digital fingerprint. Hash functions accept only one data element as input at a time and create a hash value based on the bits and bytes that make up the data. Hash values can have leading zeros to meet the required length.
219	0.5686	Secure storage of images and videos. In a blockchain, images and videos can be stored with time stamps. If they can only be retrieved from there, it would be immediately recognizable if they were later manipulated. The digital fingerprint can be used at any time for unambiguous authentication.
174	0.5656	Solving this puzzle is intentionally time-consuming. Insisting on solving the hash puzzle is one way to make the manipulation of the transaction history unjustifiably complex. Unfortunately, this security measure is accompanied by a reduced processing speed and thus a limited scalability. This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
46	0.5601	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
115	0.5417	Due to the fact that cryptographic hash values can be considered digital fingerprints, they are unique to each transaction. An essential feature of public-private key cryptography is that encrypted  text created with a key can only be decrypted with its corresponding counterpart.  The assignment of both keys is unique. With this property, digital signatures can serve as proof that the owner of the private key used to create the digital signature actually agrees with the content of the transaction.

Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
49	0.5212	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
61	0.5161	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
56	0.5055	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.

19	0.4952	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another.

157	0.4790	The smart contract is the essential core of a blockchain. It determines which actors are involved in which transactions and how, and regulates how the transfer of property, information, etc. takes place. This chapter explains some design parameters that should be considered when developing blockchain applications (public versus private blockchain, transparency versus privacy, and a few more). A small case study explains the design of a blockchain application. Application examples and design sketches show how this still young technology is currently being implemented in practice and which application perspectives already exist.
62	0.4761	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.

78	0.4889	Hashing is also used to compare data without comparing its content piece by piece. If all cryptographic hash values differ, all the data under consideration is also different. If two or more of the cryptographic hash values are identical, their corresponding input data is also identical.  Comparing hash values is a simple and efficient way to detect changes. if the newly created hash value of certain data and its old value are the same the data hash has not been changed after the old hash value was created.

86	0.4759	Hash values can also be used to allow computers to challenge other computers with elaborate puzzles. The use of hash values is one of the most important concepts of blockchain. A combination lock is a special lock that requires a unique sequence of numbers to open.  If you do not know the order of the numbers with which the lock can be opened, you can only try to systematically try all possible combinations until you finally reach the clear combination with which the lock opens.
26	0.4747	A blockchain ledger consists of two types of records, individual transactions and blocks. The first block consists of a header and data related to transactions that take place within a specified period of time. The block's timestamp is used to create an alphanumeric string called a hash (a type of unique fingerprint of the transaction).
27	0.4721	After the first block is created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the hash of the previous block to calculate its own hash. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, its authenticity must be verified through a calculation process called validation or consensus. At this point in the blockchain process, much of the nodes on the network must agree and confirm that the hash of the new block has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger use the same state.

This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
76	0.5808	Hash functions accept only one data element at a time. There is no hash function that accepts multiple independent data at the same time. In reality, however, a single hash value is often needed for a large collection of data. This can be achieved using the following patterns: Independent hashing: means that the hash function is applied to each data element independently. Repeated hashing:  is the repeated application of a hash function to one's own result.
129	0.5601	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed.

77	0.5292	Combined hashing: retrieves  a single hash value for more than one data element in one attempt. This is useful when a single hash value is required for a collection of data that is available at any given time. Sequential hashing: is the incremental updating of a hash value when new data arrives. The existing hash value is combined with new data and then passed to the hash function to get the updated hash value. Hierarchical hashing: is the creation of a single hash value for a collection of data. It combines a pair of hash values to form a small hierarchy of hash values with a single value at its top.

83	0.4754	The creation of a chain begins with the data element Data 1 and the creation of the hash reference Ref 1. As the first data element, Data 1 does not contain a hash reference. When new data arrives, it is merged with the hash reference that points to Data 1. The hash reference Ref 2 refers to the newly received data and the hash reference Ref 1. The hash reference Ref 3, which refers to Data 3 and the hash reference Ref 2, is generated in a similar way. The hash reference Ref 3 is all you need to access all the data in the chain in reverse order of its arrival.
81	0.4727	Concatenation of hash references. Merkle chains. One can store data along with hash references that reference other data, which in turn contain hash references that reference more data, and so on and so forth.

This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
79	0.5864	Detecting data changes is actually a process of comparing data before and after certain events, e.g., after a certain period of time has elapsed, when the data has been stored in a database, retrieved from a database, or sent over a network. Detecting changes to data that should remain unchanged works due to the collision resistance of cryptographic hash functions.
117	0.5727	How to detect the manipulation of a transaction? Changing data anywhere on the blockchain requires the renewal of all hash references, starting with the one that directly references the manipulated data and ending with the head of the entire blockchain as well as all hash references in between.
129	0.5669	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
121	0.5224	Replacing a transaction and its hash references in the Merkle tree invalidates the trunk of the Merkle tree, invalidating the entire data structure. Similar to the example above, the root of the Merkle tree Ref TA12 is invalid due to changes that have occurred within the Merkle tree. Therefore, we find that changing a transaction or replacing a transaction will have the same impact on the blockchain data structure. The manipulation is detected in both cases and invalidates the entire data structure.
173	0.4938	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
22	0.4829	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
125	0.4803	This means that all hash references, starting with the one that points directly to the edited data, and the hash reference, that points to the last block header, as well as all hash references in between, must be changed and updated so that they correctly reflect the changes. This is a rather complex task. All these changes are necessary to keep the entire blockchain data structure consistent and maintain its integrity. All other attempts to modify or manipulate data result in invalid hash references, which in turn invalidates the entire data structure.
116	0.4738	The challenge is to store all transaction data that has ever taken place in such a way that the order in which the transactions took place is preserved and changes to the data are detected quickly and easily. The rapid detection of changes is important to prevent manipulation of the transaction history.
79		Ensuring Data Integrity: Detecting Changes Using Collision-Resistant Cryptographic Hash Functions
79	0.6214	Detecting data changes is actually a process of comparing data before and after certain events, e.g., after a certain period of time has elapsed, when the data has been stored in a database, retrieved from a database, or sent over a network. Detecting changes to data that should remain unchanged works due to the collision resistance of cryptographic hash functions.
117	0.5665	How to detect the manipulation of a transaction? Changing data anywhere on the blockchain requires the renewal of all hash references, starting with the one that directly references the manipulated data and ending with the head of the entire blockchain as well as all hash references in between.
78	0.5381	Hashing is also used to compare data without comparing its content piece by piece. If all cryptographic hash values differ, all the data under consideration is also different. If two or more of the cryptographic hash values are identical, their corresponding input data is also identical.  Comparing hash values is a simple and efficient way to detect changes. if the newly created hash value of certain data and its old value are the same the data hash has not been changed after the old hash value was created.

One can store data along with hash references that reference other data, which in turn contain hash references that reference more data, and so on and so forth. If any of the data or hash references are changed after they are created, all subsequent hash references are invalid. Because corrupted hash references serve as evidence that data has been altered after the reference was created.

187	0.4797	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.

The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
1	0.5172	There are many misleading stories about blockchain. Much of the stories are about cryptocurrencies that led to incredible wealth or nightmare losses, or form the basis for a new financial system that supports dark markets for weapons or drugs. Blockchain is also considered a technology with enormous energy requirements. The variety of design and application possibilities of this technology and the opportunities thvat result from it are omitted from these stories.
88	0.5170	Elements of a hash puzzle are: Predefined data that must remain unchanged. Data that can be freely changed is called nonce. The hash function to apply. Restrictions on the hash value of the combined hashing, also called difficulty level.  Nonce (number that can only be used once)
227	0.5162	In 2018, the BAMF decided to evaluate the potential of blockchain technology in the context of asylum as part of a proof-of-concept project. A blockchain-based system was designed by a mixed team of science and practice. In addition to the advantages of the blockchain mentioned here, the immutability and transparency of the data in particular pose major challenges with regard to data protection. This is particularly important in the asylum process, in which extremely sensitive data must be stored and processed. The consideration of legal aspects is naturally in the foreground of such a project.
87		Hash Puzzles: Unlocking the Digital Equivalent of Combination Locks
87	0.7167	This procedure is guaranteed to open the lock, but is quite time-consuming. Systematically trying out all possible combinations has nothing to do with knowledge or intellectual thinking. The approach of opening a combination lock in this way is based on hard work. Hash puzzles  or hash puzzles are computer puzzles that can be considered the digital equivalent of the task of opening a combination lock by trying out all sorts of combinations of numbers.
86	0.6779	Hash values can also be used to allow computers to challenge other computers with elaborate puzzles. The use of hash values is one of the most important concepts of blockchain. A combination lock is a special lock that requires a unique sequence of numbers to open.  If you do not know the order of the numbers with which the lock can be opened, you can only try to systematically try all possible combinations until you finally reach the clear combination with which the lock opens.
91	0.5320	The requirement that the hash value meet a certain restriction is the core of the hash puzzle. Therefore, neither the restriction nor its description is arbitrary. Instead, the restriction used by hash puzzles is fixed, allowing computers to challenge other computers with hash puzzles.  In the context of hash puzzles, the restrictions are often referred to as difficulty or level of difficulty.
89	0.5198	Hash puzzles can only be solved by trial and error. This also requires guessing a nonce, calculating the hash value of the combined data with the required hash function, and evaluating the resulting hash value based on the restrictions. If the hash value meets all restrictions, the hash puzzle has been solved. Otherwise, you would continue with another nonce until the puzzle is finally solved. The nonce, which in combination with the specified data gives a hash value that meets the constraints, is called a solution. You must always present this particular nonce if you want to claim that you have solved the puzzle.

This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
175	0.4418	High costs. Solving the hash puzzle is intentionally computationally intensive. It is the security measure that makes the history of transaction data immutable. This proof is expensive. Thus, there are costs for the entire blockchain. The amount of these costs depends on the difficulty of the puzzles.
77	0.4323	Combined hashing: retrieves  a single hash value for more than one data element in one attempt. This is useful when a single hash value is required for a collection of data that is available at any given time. Sequential hashing: is the incremental updating of a hash value when new data arrives. The existing hash value is combined with new data and then passed to the hash function to get the updated hash value. Hierarchical hashing: is the creation of a single hash value for a collection of data. It combines a pair of hash values to form a small hierarchy of hash values with a single value at its top.
90	0.4257	Let's consider a puzzle to illustrate how it works. The shortened hash value of Hello World! is 7F83B165. But what data combined with Hello World! would result in a hash value with three leading zeros? So, the riddle is: Find the nonce, that together with Hello World! results in a hash value starting with three leading zeros. The Nonce 614 solves the puzzle. If the restriction had been to find a hash value with a leading zero, the puzzle would have been solved after just four steps.
115	0.4224	Due to the fact that cryptographic hash values can be considered digital fingerprints, they are unique to each transaction. An essential feature of public-private key cryptography is that encrypted  text created with a key can only be decrypted with its corresponding counterpart.  The assignment of both keys is unique. With this property, digital signatures can serve as proof that the owner of the private key used to create the digital signature actually agrees with the content of the transaction.

27	0.5057	After the first block is created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the hash of the previous block to calculate its own hash. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, its authenticity must be verified through a calculation process called validation or consensus.

94		Securing Ownership and Exclusivity: Identity and Access Control in Blockchain
94	0.6991	The blockchain must uniquely identify participants and assets and ensure that only the rightful owner can access their property. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system that is open to all. Anyone can connect and provision computing resources or send new transaction data to the system. However, it is not desirable for everyone to access the asset that is assigned to the account managed by the blockchain. An essential feature of private property is its exclusivity. The right to transfer ownership to another account is limited to the owner of the account who hands over ownership.
111	0.6277	By signing and verifying transactions, the transfer of ownership in blockchain is authorized.
56	0.6270	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
184	0.6022	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
166	0.5888	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
103	0.5886	The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to achieve two goals: Identify accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys. Authorize transactions: The owner of the account that hands over ownership creates an encrypted text with the corresponding private key. This encrypted text can be validated using the appropriate public key. This is the number of the account that hands over ownership.
62	0.5879	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
104	0.5828	The blockchain must ensure that only the owner of one account can transfer the associated asset to other accounts. The transfer of ownership is based on a digital security measure corresponding to the handwritten signature and serves the same purpose: Identify an account, Instruction of the owner, which relating to the content of the corresponding transaction and Approval of the execution by adding the data to its transaction history.
43	0.5772	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
163	0.5755	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
95		Public and Private Keys: Ensuring Account Security in Cryptography
46	0.5823	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
172	0.5666	The private key is the only security tool that authorizes the rightful owner. Once an account's private key is intentionally, accidentally, or leaked to another user due to data theft, the security of that single account is no longer guaranteed. There are no additional security measures in place to protect the property associated with an account number.
103	0.5474	The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to achieve two goals: Identify accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys. Authorize transactions: The owner of the account that hands over ownership creates an encrypted text with the corresponding private key. This encrypted text can be validated using the appropriate public key. This is the number of the account that hands over ownership.
171	0.5154	The Security Model. The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to identify and authenticate actors and authorize transactions. Account numbers on the blockchain are actually public cryptographic keys. Only the person who has the appropriate private key can access the property associated with an account. Only transaction data that contains a digital signature created with the appropriate private key is valid and can transfer ownership from one account to another.
115	0.4960	Due to the fact that cryptographic hash values can be considered digital fingerprints, they are unique to each transaction. An essential feature of public-private key cryptography is that encrypted  text created with a key can only be decrypted with its corresponding counterpart.  The assignment of both keys is unique. With this property, digital signatures can serve as proof that the owner of the private key used to create the digital signature actually agrees with the content of the transaction.
185	0.4912	However, this approach is contrary to the concept of privacy. Privacy means that transactional data, or details of how the accounts involved or the amount transferred, should remain hidden from the public. The resulting conflict consists, on the one hand, in the transparency required to clarify ownership and, on the other hand, in the higher data protection requirements of users.
100	0.4811	The first steps that must be taken with any application of asymmetric cryptography are: Create a pair of complementary keys using cryptographic software. One key becomes the public key, the other one becomes the private key. A specific member keeps the private key to himself, that passes the public key to all other members.
102	0.4728	Private to public: The use of asymmetric cryptography in this direction is about proving authorship. It works because anyone can use the public key to decrypt encrypted text created with the corresponding private key. the fact that encrypted text created with the private key can only be decrypted with the appropriate public key serves as proof that the owner of the corresponding private key has encrypted the message.
21	0.4621	Ledgers or account books have been around for a long, long time. In the past, of course, they were only available in paper form. With increasing digitalization, the account books are managed digitally. Traditionally, a central authority has been responsible and responsible for validating ledger entries. For example, banks are required to review financial transactions. However, the original form of the ledger still serves as a metaphor for the secure storage of transaction data. Computerized ledgers usually mirror what once existed on paper.
166	0.4604	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
96		Asymmetric Cryptography: The Power of Key Pairs and Message Encryption
101	0.6151	There are two general ways to use the key pair that differ in the direction in which the data flows: public to private. private to public. Public to private: Using asymmetric cryptography here is about sending information to the owner of the private key in a secure way. It works because anyone can create text encrypted with the public key, but only the owner of the private key can decrypt that text and read the message.

96	0.5781	Asymmetric cryptography always uses two complementary keys. However, this has a trick: encrypted text created with one of these keys can only be decrypted with the other key and vice versa. Let's say es gives two keys: a yellow and a red key. Together they form the pair of corresponding keys. The original message is encrypted with the yellow key that provides the encrypted text represented in the left blue box.
97	0.5449	The original message can also be encrypted with the second (red) key, resulting in a different encrypted text displayed in the right blue box. The trick with asymmetric cryptography is that you can't decrypt encrypted text with the key it was created with. The decision as to which key to use for encryption and which to use for decryption is up to  the members. You can change the roles of the keys for each new data element that you want to encrypt. However, you must always have both keys for encryption and decryption.  If you only have one of the keys, the possibilities are limited.
102	0.5419	Private to public: The use of asymmetric cryptography in this direction is about proving authorship. It works because anyone can use the public key to decrypt encrypted text created with the corresponding private key. the fact that encrypted text created with the private key can only be decrypted with the appropriate public key serves as proof that the owner of the corresponding private key has encrypted the message.

It is unique in two ways: First, the message can be uniquely traced back to you because you created it with your unique private key.

103	0.7351	The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to achieve two goals: Identify accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys. Authorize transactions: The owner of the account that hands over ownership creates an encrypted text with the corresponding private key. This encrypted text can be validated using the appropriate public key. This is the number of the account that hands over ownership.
171	0.6322	The Security Model. The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to identify and authenticate actors and authorize transactions. Account numbers on the blockchain are actually public cryptographic keys. Only the person who has the appropriate private key can access the property associated with an account. Only transaction data that contains a digital signature created with the appropriate private key is valid and can transfer ownership from one account to another.
46	0.5611	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
104	0.5523	The blockchain must ensure that only the owner of one account can transfer the associated asset to other accounts. The transfer of ownership is based on a digital security measure corresponding to the handwritten signature and serves the same purpose: Identify an account, Instruction of the owner, which relating to the content of the corresponding transaction and Approval of the execution by adding the data to its transaction history.

111	0.5292	By signing and verifying transactions, the transfer of ownership in blockchain is authorized.
43	0.5172	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
94	0.5107	The blockchain must uniquely identify participants and assets and ensure that only the rightful owner can access their property. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system that is open to all. Anyone can connect and provision computing resources or send new transaction data to the system. However, it is not desirable for everyone to access the asset that is assigned to the account managed by the blockchain. An essential feature of private property is its exclusivity. The right to transfer ownership to another account is limited to the owner of the account who hands over ownership.

49	0.5319	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
159	0.5311	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
115	0.5275	Due to the fact that cryptographic hash values can be considered digital fingerprints, they are unique to each transaction. An essential feature of public-private key cryptography is that encrypted  text created with a key can only be decrypted with its corresponding counterpart.  The assignment of both keys is unique.

51	0.5236	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
126	0.5183	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.

With this property, digital signatures can serve as proof that the owner of the private key used to create the digital signature actually agrees with the content of the transaction.
156	0.4535	However, it is impossible for any attacker who has less computing power than the majority to take a new path, catching up with and overtaking the path taken by the majority. Therefore, any attempt to set up a new authorized path that contains fraudulent transactions will be overtaken and rejected by the path maintained by the honest majority. As a result, the history of transactions managed by the system is robust against manipulation.
187	0.4467	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.
111		Authorization of transactions
111	0.6541	By signing and verifying transactions, the transfer of ownership in blockchain is authorized.
72	0.5621	Limit the number of transactions per user. Limit the total quantity of items/assets that can be sold in a given period. Enforce that an account retains an item/asset for a minimum period of time before it can be further transferred. Authorization. Only the owner of the account who hands over ownership should be allowed to instruct the blockchain to execute a transaction on their behalf.
38	0.5396	Access via access authorization as an alternative to uncontrolled access without authorization check, which may meet existing regulations in the company.
42	0.5241	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
70	0.5240	The complete history of transaction data is a process chain that provides information about how people acquired and transferred ownership. Any transaction that is not part of this history is considered as if it never happened. A transaction is executed by adding it to the history of the transaction data. The order in which transaction data is added to the history must be preserved. Only transaction data that meets the following three criteria are added to the Blockchain: Formal correctness. Semantic correctness. Authorization
94	0.5130	The blockchain must uniquely identify participants and assets and ensure that only the rightful owner can access their property. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system that is open to all. Anyone can connect and provision computing resources or send new transaction data to the system. However, it is not desirable for everyone to access the asset that is assigned to the account managed by the blockchain. An essential feature of private property is its exclusivity. The right to transfer ownership to another account is limited to the owner of the account who hands over ownership.
166	0.5123	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
156	0.5046	However, it is impossible for any attacker who has less computing power than the majority to take a new path, catching up with and overtaking the path taken by the majority. Therefore, any attempt to set up a new authorized path that contains fraudulent transactions will be overtaken and rejected by the path maintained by the honest majority. As a result, the history of transactions managed by the system is robust against manipulation.
58	0.5015	Identification means identifying oneself as a specific person. Authentication means proving that this person is really the one you are working for. Authorization means being able to access something because of the previously authenticated identity.
215	0.5008	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
112		Digital Signature Generation: Ensuring Secure Transaction Authorization
112	0.6001	To create a digital signature for a transaction, the owner of the account transferring ownership performs the following steps: Description of the transaction with all the necessary information such as the account numbers involved and the transfer amount. Creation of the cryptographic hash value of the transaction data. Encryption of the hash value of the transaction data with the account holder's private key. Linking the transaction to the encrypted text created under point 3 as a digital signature.
104	0.5092	The blockchain must ensure that only the owner of one account can transfer the associated asset to other accounts.

This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
113	0.4635	To verify a transaction, the following steps must be performed: Creation of a hash value of the transaction data to be verified with the exception of the signature. Decryption of the digital signature of the transaction in question with the account number to transfer ownership. Comparison of the hash value of step 1 with the value obtained in step 2. If both are identical, the transaction is authorized by the owner of the private key, which corresponds to the account transferring ownership, otherwise it will not be authorized.
187	0.4621	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.

106	0.4376	Suppose you want to send Schmalkalden in an authorized manner. You write Schmalkalden, create the hash value of this text (216B62CD) and encrypt it with your private key. The encrypted text of the hash value of your message is your digital signature. It is unique in two ways: First, the message can be uniquely traced back to you because you created it with your unique private key. Secondly, it is unique in terms of text because it is based on the digital fingerprint of the message. Both the message and the digital signature are combined in one file.
113		Digital Signature Verification: Ensuring Secure Transaction Validation
113	0.6112	To verify a transaction, the following steps must be performed: Creation of a hash value of the transaction data to be verified with the exception of the signature.

49	0.4812	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
109	0.4799	In the same way that you verify the authenticity of the message, you can determine if your message has been modified: The recipient of the message (or anyone who was able to intercept the message) himself creates the hash value of the modified message (Schmalkladen), which gives the value 898272F7. The recipient of your message then decrypts the digital signature with your public key. This results in 216B62CD as the hash value of the version of the message you wanted to send.
56	0.4639	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.

102	0.5288	Private to public: The use of asymmetric cryptography in this direction is about proving authorship. It works because anyone can use the public key to decrypt encrypted text created with the corresponding private key. the fact that encrypted text created with the private key can only be decrypted with the appropriate public key serves as proof that the owner of the corresponding private key has encrypted the message.

116		Preserving Transaction Order and Ensuring Data Integrity in Blockchain
65	0.6418	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.

The rapid detection of changes is important to prevent manipulation of the transaction history.
189	0.5931	The exact temporal assignment (time stamp) and the immutability of the transaction data is an important aspect of blockchains. Once stored, data can no longer be changed. This can be a problem if the General Data Protection Regulation gives users the right to be forgotten and all of a user's personal data must be deleted. Any design of a blockchain that is contrary to legal regulations is automatically doomed to failure. In the present case, it makes sense to separate the personal data from the actual transaction data via a link.
129	0.5921	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.

121	0.5691	Replacing a transaction and its hash references in the Merkle tree invalidates the trunk of the Merkle tree, invalidating the entire data structure. Similar to the example above, the root of the Merkle tree Ref TA12 is invalid due to changes that have occurred within the Merkle tree. Therefore, we find that changing a transaction or replacing a transaction will have the same impact on the blockchain data structure.

This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.
117		How Blockchain Detects and Prevents Transaction Manipulation through Hash Reference Renewal
117	0.7105	How to detect the manipulation of a transaction? Changing data anywhere on the blockchain requires the renewal of all hash references, starting with the one that directly references the manipulated data and ending with the head of the entire blockchain as well as all hash references in between.
121	0.5945	Replacing a transaction and its hash references in the Merkle tree invalidates the trunk of the Merkle tree, invalidating the entire data structure. Similar to the example above, the root of the Merkle tree Ref TA12 is invalid due to changes that have occurred within the Merkle tree. Therefore, we find that changing a transaction or replacing a transaction will have the same impact on the blockchain data structure. The manipulation is detected in both cases and invalidates the entire data structure.
118	0.5773	What happens if transaction 2 is changed? This transaction is part of a Merkle tree consisting of various hash references. By changing some properties of transaction 2 (e.B. the quantity of goods transferred or the account receiving ownership), the fingerprint or cryptographic hash value is also changed. As a result, the hash reference Ref TA2, which pointed to the original transaction data, is corrupted. It is noted that the originally stated transaction data has been changed in the meantime. As a result, the entire blockchain is invalid.
119	0.5586	What happens when you change not only details of a transaction, but also the hash reference that points to the updated transaction? The updated hash reference (Ref TA2) is valid because it correctly references the new transaction data. However, the updated hash reference is part of a Merkle tree whose root is also a hash reference. The root of the Merkle tree (Ref TA12) points to a data element that contains the hash references Ref TA1 and Ref TA2.
27	0.5480	After the first block is created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the hash of the previous block to calculate its own hash. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, its authenticity must be verified through a calculation process called validation or consensus. At this point in the blockchain process, much of the nodes on the network must agree and confirm that the hash of the new block has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger use the same state.
174	0.5475	Solving this puzzle is intentionally time-consuming. Insisting on solving the hash puzzle is one way to make the manipulation of the transaction history unjustifiably complex. Unfortunately, this security measure is accompanied by a reduced processing speed and thus a limited scalability. This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
25	0.5465	Transaction: Two parties decide to exchange a thing (property, certificate, etc.). Block: The transaction is packaged with other pending transactions creating a „block“. The block is sent to the blockchain network of participating computers.  Verification: The participating computers (called “miners” in the Bitcoin world) determine whether the transactions are valid. If a majority of computers declare the transactions valid, they are considered valid and a “consensus” among the participants has been reached. Blockchain and its processes (continued) Hash: Each verified block of transactions is time-stamped with a cryptographic hash. Each block holds a reference to the previous block’s hash value. This results in a chain of blocks that can hardly be tampered. Execution: The unit of value moves from the account of one party to the account of the other party.
125	0.5399	This means that all hash references, starting with the one that points directly to the edited data, and the hash reference, that points to the last block header, as well as all hash references in between, must be changed and updated so that they correctly reflect the changes. This is a rather complex task. All these changes are necessary to keep the entire blockchain data structure consistent and maintain its integrity. All other attempts to modify or manipulate data result in invalid hash references, which in turn invalidates the entire data structure.
81	0.5365	Concatenation of hash references. Merkle chains. One can store data along with hash references that reference other data, which in turn contain hash references that reference more data, and so on and so forth. If any of the data or hash references are changed after they are created, all subsequent hash references are invalid. Because corrupted hash references serve as evidence that data has been altered after the reference was created.
130	0.5255	In the previous chapter, it was explained that any change to a transaction also entails a change in its hash value, which is immediately widely visible to all actors. The all-or-nothing principle of blockchain technology requires that even the smallest changes to transaction data require the redesign of the entire Merkle tree, including all the necessary hash puzzles. This makes every change attempt immensely expensive. In a blockchain, actors must repeatedly be able to reach consensus in order to record a transaction (or series of transactions) on the ledger. Usually, the consensus is organized in discrete rounds, in which the participants start the round r + 1 after the round r comes to a close.
118		The Impact of Transaction Modification on the Validity of the Blockchain
121	0.6494	Replacing a transaction and its hash references in the Merkle tree invalidates the trunk of the Merkle tree, invalidating the entire data structure. Similar to the example above, the root of the Merkle tree Ref TA12 is invalid due to changes that have occurred within the Merkle tree. Therefore, we find that changing a transaction or replacing a transaction will have the same impact on the blockchain data structure. The manipulation is detected in both cases and invalidates the entire data structure.
180	0.5711	Non-technical limitations of the blockchain. The main non-technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of legal recognition. Lack of user acceptance
154	0.5675	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
129	0.5656	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
65	0.5633	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
173	0.5439	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
156	0.5427	However, it is impossible for any attacker who has less computing power than the majority to take a new path, catching up with and overtaking the path taken by the majority. Therefore, any attempt to set up a new authorized path that contains fraudulent transactions will be overtaken and rejected by the path maintained by the honest majority. As a result, the history of transactions managed by the system is robust against manipulation.
37	0.5399	For a company, blockchain offers the following basic possibilities: A design approach that keeps transaction data, value, and status inherently close to business logic. The necessary data schemas for transactional data are easier to manage. Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.
182	0.5361	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system. Those who have witnessed the emergence and development of the Internet may see a similarity between the legal status of today's blockchain and the lack of legal acceptance of e-commerce in the nineties.
118	0.5361	What happens if transaction 2 is changed? This transaction is part of a Merkle tree consisting of various hash references. By changing some properties of transaction 2 (e.B. the quantity of goods transferred or the account receiving ownership), the fingerprint or cryptographic hash value is also changed. As a result, the hash reference Ref TA2, which pointed to the original transaction data, is corrupted. It is noted that the originally stated transaction data has been changed in the meantime. As a result, the entire blockchain is invalid.
119		The Impact of Hash Reference Changes on the Integrity of the Merkle Tree in a Blockchain
121	0.7533	Replacing a transaction and its hash references in the Merkle tree invalidates the trunk of the Merkle tree, invalidating the entire data structure. Similar to the example above, the root of the Merkle tree Ref TA12 is invalid due to changes that have occurred within the Merkle tree. Therefore, we find that changing a transaction or replacing a transaction will have the same impact on the blockchain data structure. The manipulation is detected in both cases and invalidates the entire data structure.

One can store data along with hash references that reference other data, which in turn contain hash references that reference more data, and so on and so forth. If any of the data or hash references are changed after they are created, all subsequent hash references are invalid. Because corrupted hash references serve as evidence that data has been altered after the reference was created.

119	0.6113	What happens when you change not only details of a transaction, but also the hash reference that points to the updated transaction? The updated hash reference (Ref TA2) is valid because it correctly references the new transaction data. However, the updated hash reference is part of a Merkle tree whose root is also a hash reference. The root of the Merkle tree (Ref TA12) points to a data element that contains the hash references Ref TA1 and Ref TA2.

All other attempts to modify or manipulate data result in invalid hash references, which in turn invalidates the entire data structure.
174	0.5672	Solving this puzzle is intentionally time-consuming. Insisting on solving the hash puzzle is one way to make the manipulation of the transaction history unjustifiably complex. Unfortunately, this security measure is accompanied by a reduced processing speed and thus a limited scalability. This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
130	0.5662	In the previous chapter, it was explained that any change to a transaction also entails a change in its hash value, which is immediately widely visible to all actors. The all-or-nothing principle of blockchain technology requires that even the smallest changes to transaction data require the redesign of the entire Merkle tree, including all the necessary hash puzzles. This makes every change attempt immensely expensive. In a blockchain, actors must repeatedly be able to reach consensus in order to record a transaction (or series of transactions) on the ledger. Usually, the consensus is organized in discrete rounds, in which the participants start the round r + 1 after the round r comes to a close.

126		Decentralized Trust and Consensus in Blockchain Applications
126	0.6771	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
19	0.6593	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
159	0.6397	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus.

The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.
22	0.6028	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
43	0.5959	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
168	0.5720	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
46	0.5701	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
127		Automated Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain: Agreement, Closing, and Validity
126	0.6468	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.

Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
166	0.5845	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
181	0.5642	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
159	0.5629	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
127	0.5610	Whether a transaction is valid is therefore decided by the majority of actors. However, not all actors are asked for their opinions. The consensus should be reached automatically. There are several mechanisms for designing and implementing an automated consensus. In principle, any actor can propose a transaction that is posted to the ledger. At a certain point in time, however, only one transaction is selected for posting. All honest actors agree on which transaction was selected (agreement), all honest participants finally learn which was the selected transaction (closing) and that the selected transaction was considered valid (validity).
44	0.5528	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
158	0.5477	A blockchain is a distributed, shared, and digital ledger that records the timing of validated facts. These facts can refer to tangible and intangible objects, to money or simply to information. As part of this digital system of recording, each transaction and its details are validated and then recorded in a network of computers. Anyone who has access to the distributed ledger can view this information. All actors on the network agree on the accuracy of the transaction data before the block is replicated, shared, and synchronized between the distributed locations.
3	0.5451	Strictly speaking, blockchain and distributed technology is less a technology itself, but rather a technology group that can be characterized, at least from an algorithmic point of view, via a protocol of chaining, distribution, and consensus. The basic principles have been known for a long time and have also been used in the context of public data security.
65	0.5409	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
128		Protective Measures in Blockchain: Accounting for Dishonest Actors and Complexity of Manipulation
128	0.7157	The protocol of the accounting takes into account that some actors are honest and follow the protocol, while others are dishonest and deviate from the protocol, as in real life, when many people participate in a common cause. A blockchain is open to any actor. But even if it weren't open to every actor, we can't assume that we can trust everyone in the user community. The protective mechanism that offers itself here is to make any kind of manipulation immensely complex.
154	0.6387	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
184	0.6254	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
51	0.6039	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
43	0.5978	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs.

On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
61	0.5926	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
170	0.5876	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.
65	0.5794	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth.

It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
42	0.5781	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
156	0.5733	However, it is impossible for any attacker who has less computing power than the majority to take a new path, catching up with and overtaking the path taken by the majority. Therefore, any attempt to set up a new authorized path that contains fraudulent transactions will be overtaken and rejected by the path maintained by the honest majority. As a result, the history of transactions managed by the system is robust against manipulation.
129		Principles of Blockchain Technology: Immutable Transaction History and Computational Intensity
129	0.7473	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
154	0.5895	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
19	0.5888	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
164	0.5724	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus. Permissionless or public blockchains offer a platform for new business models. However, by definition, they are based on a very computationally intensive computational model to ensure transaction integrity.
173	0.5703	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
174	0.5698	Solving this puzzle is intentionally time-consuming. Insisting on solving the hash puzzle is one way to make the manipulation of the transaction history unjustifiably complex. Unfortunately, this security measure is accompanied by a reduced processing speed and thus a limited scalability. This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
43	0.5545	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs.

On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
178	0.5525	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.
70	0.5458	The complete history of transaction data is a process chain that provides information about how people acquired and transferred ownership. Any transaction that is not part of this history is considered as if it never happened. A transaction is executed by adding it to the history of the transaction data. The order in which transaction data is added to the history must be preserved. Only transaction data that meets the following three criteria are added to the Blockchain: Formal correctness. Semantic correctness. Authorization
64	0.5411	Design of ledgers for distributed and untrusted environments. The best way to prevent the transaction history from being changed is to make it immutable. This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.

215	0.5799	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).

49	0.5640	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
56	0.5595	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner.

133		Costly Signaling: Proof of Work in Blockchain Consensus
61	0.6066	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
205	0.6044	In the blockchain world, costly signaling is usually called proof of work (PoW). In PoW, consensus is reached by holding a self-administered lottery among the miners to decide which transaction is appended next to the ledger. Here is the clever part: buying a lottery ticket is a form of costly signaling because, well, it is costly: expensive in terms of time wasted and electricity bills. Kate’s talent for impersonation is useless to her if each of her fake miners must buy an expensive, long shot lottery ticket.
166	0.6029	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT.

133	0.5542	Here, what sociologists call costly signaling is used as an exam: the candidate has to do something expensive and difficult, such as robbing a shop or getting a gang symbol tattooed. Then he is considered trustworthy. In the blockchain world, costly signaling is commonly referred to as proof of work (PoW). In PoW, consensus is reached by holding a lottery among the players to decide which transaction to append next to the ledger. Buying a lottery ticket is a form of costly signaling because it is expensive: expensive in terms of time and energy expenditure. Especially in the PoW lottery, players compete to solve a puzzle. The first actor to solve the puzzle wins the consensus and selects the next block to attach to the ledger. If this block is valid, this actor will also receive a reward, but the other actors will receive nothing and will have to start a new puzzle. Therefore, the work to solve the riddle is adequately remunerated. This wage is intended to compensate for the energy applied (and the use of special hardware) and also to enable a profit. It consists of the current Block Reward, i.e., the salary for writing a new block into the blockchain, and the agreed transaction fees.

However, sharing information between members in the blockchain system and updating individual ledgers will take time. Some members already know about the last transfer of ownership, while others have not yet received this information. At this point, the system is not consistent.  
134		Protocol Criteria for Valid Transaction Sequence: Longest Chain vs. Heaviest Chain
134	0.8304	Therefore, the idea arose to define a protocol for determining the valid transaction sequence based on the computational effort. Two criteria can be used for this: The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the heaviest chain
135	0.5856	The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the longest chain is based on the idea that the blockchain data structure, which includes the most blocks, represents the greater computational effort. Let's look for a starting point in which all actors of a distributed system have agreed on the same version of an existing blockchain:
138	0.5042	As a result, the majority of actors have a blockchain, which now consists of two branches on a common trunk. In such a situation, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result, since both chains have the same length. Some actors may try to find a new block that points to block AB12 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that points to block DD01 as its predecessor.
142	0.5012	The criterion of the heaviest chain. Blockchain applications rarely use a consistent level of difficulty for the puzzle to be solved when a new block is to be added to the blockchain data structure. Instead, they usually determine the difficulty level dynamically, which distinguishes the blocks in terms of the computational effort spent on adding them to the blockchain.
143	0.4965	The criterion of the longest chain is based on the idea that the path containing the most blocks represents the greatest computational effort. With heterogeneous difficulty levels, however, the longest path is not necessarily the one that represents the greatest computational effort. For each path, the computational effort required for this can be set to add up the difficulty of all associated blocks. This value can be calculated using the fact that the block header contains the difficulty level of its hash puzzle. The cumulative difficulty level of a path is often referred to as its weight.
144	0.4935	The longest chain (the path from root 33FF to leaf 0101) has a weight of 5, while the second longest chain (the path from root to leaf CCC1) has a weight of 6. Blockchains that include the level of difficulty use the criterion of the heaviest  chain, in this case the second chain is chosen.
140	0.4854	The result of incorporating these two new blocks into the blockchain is a data structure that contains three branches. One of the branches consists of only three blocks, while the other two consist of four blocks. The criterion of the longest chain clearly excludes the shortest chain. However, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result during this, as it gives two chains of the same length. As a result, some actors may try to find a new block that refers to block BB11 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that refers to block CCC1 as its predecessor.
152	0.4620	Even if a selection criterion yields ambiguous results, the conflicting, versions of the transaction history result from a less ambiguous common root. The deeper the blockchain, the less ambiguous the decision as to which is the longest chain. Consider the situation where the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result: BB11 & CCC1 → AB12 & DD01 → A397 → 33FF. As we see in the next situation, the next block (0101) added to the blockchain determines whether block BB11 or CCC1 is either part of the longest chain or is abandoned instead. But who decides that the next block to be added to the blockchain will reference block BB11 as its predecessor and therefore to abandon block CCC1?
187	0.4425	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.
145	0.4361	Following the selection of a chain. Selecting a particular chain from conflicting versions and determining it as the authoritative order has the following consequences: Orphaned blocks. Reclaimed renumeration. Clarification of ownership. Preparation of transactions. A growing common tribe. Robustness against manipulation
135		Consensus on Initial Blockchain Version: Starting Point for Distributed System Actors
126	0.6408	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
168	0.6188	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
181	0.5585	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
131	0.5445	One could assume that a consensus is reached if the majority of actors agree to the decision to attach a particular transaction to the blockchain. A block would be accepted if 51% of the actors agree with this block. However, this is nonsense, as you can never know exactly how many actors are currently on the net. In the blockchain world, the actor is considered a recognized representative of the majority of all actors, who first solves the hash puzzle with a given level of difficulty, i.e., determines the hash value with the given number of leading zeros.
166	0.5337	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
65	0.5305	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
19	0.5247	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
22	0.5182	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
215	0.5123	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
164	0.5121	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus. Permissionless or public blockchains offer a platform for new business models. However, by definition, they are based on a very computationally intensive computational model to ensure transaction integrity.
136		Consensus on Block Addition: Majority Agreement on Block Order in Blockchain

This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
27	0.5374	After the first block is created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the hash of the previous block to calculate its own hash. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, its authenticity must be verified through a calculation process called validation or consensus. At this point in the blockchain process, much of the nodes on the network must agree and confirm that the hash of the new block has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the distributed ledger use the same state.
61	0.5136	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.

137		Delayed Block Transmission: Minority Actors Catching Up with the wrong block
137	0.5437	Due to a delay in the transmission of messages, a minority of actors have not yet received block AB12. Therefore, they are still trying to extend the original chain. In the meantime, an actor proposes a new transaction for accounting. Its new block has a hash value of DD01 and is passed to the other actors. The majority of the actors receive both block AB12 and block DD01 as new blocks.
139	0.5267	Suddenly, the majority of actors receive two new blocks, BB11 and CCC1, both of which refer to block AB12 as their predecessor. This can happen when two actors complete the proof of work (or other authorization) for their blocks almost simultaneously.
153	0.4746	The surprising and perhaps disappointing answer is: coincidence. Actors are free to decide which branch they want to expand. The actor who solves the puzzle of a new block first decides which of the conflicting branches will be expanded and which blocks will be abandoned.
131	0.4205	One could assume that a consensus is reached if the majority of actors agree to the decision to attach a particular transaction to the blockchain. A block would be accepted if 51% of the actors agree with this block. However, this is nonsense, as you can never know exactly how many actors are currently on the net. In the blockchain world, the actor is considered a recognized representative of the majority of all actors, who first solves the hash puzzle with a given level of difficulty, i.e., determines the hash value with the given number of leading zeros.
138	0.3548	As a result, the majority of actors have a blockchain, which now consists of two branches on a common trunk. In such a situation, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result, since both chains have the same length. Some actors may try to find a new block that points to block AB12 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that points to block DD01 as its predecessor.
177	0.3501	The remaining group of actors forms an oligopoly that divides responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the system among themselves. Much like oligopolies in other industries, this small group of actors could abuse their power. This effect creates a kind of hidden centrality that undermines the distributed nature of the entire system. From a technical point of view, such a system is still a distributed system, but it is a system whose integrity is maintained only by a small number of actors.
176	0.3480	Hidden centrality. The need to solve a puzzle for each block added to the blockchain data structure, and the rules for distributing rewards that contribute to the integrity of the system, lead to an arms race between actors in terms of their computing power. The supposedly large and democratic group of actors who together maintain the integrity of the system eventually become a very small group of actors who have enormous computing power, often in the form of specialized hardware.
155	0.3394	To manipulate an inner block, an attacker would have to repeat the proof of the work of that block and then the hash puzzle of all subsequent blocks, and then catch up with and overtake the path maintained by the honest actors.
202	0.3138	Customers wishing to buy or sell coupons send their transactions to this gossip network. A group of volunteer miners pick up these transactions, batch them into blocks for efficiency, and collectively execute repeated consensus protocols to append these blocks to the shared ledger, which is itself broadcast over the gossip network. Every miner, and everyone else who cares, keeps a local copy of the ledger, kept more-or-less up-to-date over the gossip network.
136	0.2830	Each of the boxes represents a block marked with a shortened hash value. The arrow pointing from one box to another represents the hash reference that links a block header to its predecessor. In this initial situation, all actors agree on a history of the transaction data and strive for an extension of the existing chain by another block, which refers to block A397 as its predecessor. If a transaction is now proposed for accounting, a new block is written for the blockchain. The following order is the one that the majority of actors will find once the new block has been added.
138		Blockchain Fork: Divergence of Chains with Equal Lengths Based on Different Predecessors
140	0.6097	The result of incorporating these two new blocks into the blockchain is a data structure that contains three branches. One of the branches consists of only three blocks, while the other two consist of four blocks. The criterion of the longest chain clearly excludes the shortest chain. However, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result during this, as it gives two chains of the same length. As a result, some actors may try to find a new block that refers to block BB11 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that refers to block CCC1 as its predecessor.

In such a situation, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result, since both chains have the same length. Some actors may try to find a new block that points to block AB12 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that points to block DD01 as its predecessor.
152	0.5399	Even if a selection criterion yields ambiguous results, the conflicting, versions of the transaction history result from a less ambiguous common root. The deeper the blockchain, the less ambiguous the decision as to which is the longest chain. Consider the situation where the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result: BB11 & CCC1 → AB12 & DD01 → A397 → 33FF. As we see in the next situation, the next block (0101) added to the blockchain determines whether block BB11 or CCC1 is either part of the longest chain or is abandoned instead. But who decides that the next block to be added to the blockchain will reference block BB11 as its predecessor and therefore to abandon block CCC1?
147	0.4992	For example, if the criterion of the longest chain is applied to the situation shown again in the previous slide, the blocks DD01 and CCC1 are not part of the longest chain and are abandoned. If the criterion of the heaviest chain is applied to the last situation shown here again, blocks 0101, BB11 and DD01 are not part of the authorized chain and are therefore abandoned.
151	0.4936	Ambiguous common trunk. Applying a selection criterion does not always lead to a clear result. For example, in situations like the one in the first two situations above (shown here gaian) , there is more than one longest chain. In these situations, the blockchain has two paths of equal length starting from a common root. The common trunk consists of only two blocks that form a short chain A397 → 33FF. Later, the common trunk already consists of three blocks that form the chain AB12 → A397 → 33FF and contains the common trunk of the previous situation.
135	0.4930	The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the longest chain is based on the idea that the blockchain data structure, which includes the most blocks, represents the greater computational effort. Let's look for a starting point in which all actors of a distributed system have agreed on the same version of an existing blockchain:
141	0.4927	Finally, a new block is entered, referring to block BB11 as its predecessor, resulting in the following blockchain. It contains many conflicting versions of the transaction history, but the criterion of the longest chain gives a clear result, namely the chain, which consists of blocks 0101 → BB11 → AB12 → A397 → 33FF. The majority of actors and eventually all actors in the system now use this chain to clarify ownership-related requirements that are mapped in transactions. They strive to expand this branch by finding a new block that points to block 0101 as its predecessor.
145	0.4894	Following the selection of a chain. Selecting a particular chain from conflicting versions and determining it as the authoritative order has the following consequences: Orphaned blocks.

142	0.4708	The criterion of the heaviest chain. Blockchain applications rarely use a consistent level of difficulty for the puzzle to be solved when a new block is to be added to the blockchain data structure. Instead, they usually determine the difficulty level dynamically, which distinguishes the blocks in terms of the computational effort spent on adding them to the blockchain.
144	0.4660	The longest chain (the path from root 33FF to leaf 0101) has a weight of 5, while the second longest chain (the path from root to leaf CCC1) has a weight of 6. Blockchains that include the level of difficulty use the criterion of the heaviest  chain, in this case the second chain is chosen.
139		Simultaneous Block Validation: Multiple Blocks Extending the Same Predecessor
140	0.4818	The result of incorporating these two new blocks into the blockchain is a data structure that contains three branches. One of the branches consists of only three blocks, while the other two consist of four blocks. The criterion of the longest chain clearly excludes the shortest chain.

But who decides that the next block to be added to the blockchain will reference block BB11 as its predecessor and therefore to abandon block CCC1?
123	0.4028	Replacement of an entire subtree and its references. Changing a hash reference within a block header invalidates the hash reference that refers to the edited block header, which in turn invalidates the entire data structure.

147	0.5648	For example, if the criterion of the longest chain is applied to the situation shown again in the previous slide, the blocks DD01 and CCC1 are not part of the longest chain and are abandoned.

This value can be calculated using the fact that the block header contains the difficulty level of its hash puzzle. The cumulative difficulty level of a path is often referred to as its weight.

Let's look for a starting point in which all actors of a distributed system have agreed on the same version of an existing blockchain:
147	0.5553	For example, if the criterion of the longest chain is applied to the situation shown again in the previous slide, the blocks DD01 and CCC1 are not part of the longest chain and are abandoned. If the criterion of the heaviest chain is applied to the last situation shown here again, blocks 0101, BB11 and DD01 are not part of the authorized chain and are therefore abandoned.
140	0.5305	The result of incorporating these two new blocks into the blockchain is a data structure that contains three branches. One of the branches consists of only three blocks, while the other two consist of four blocks. The criterion of the longest chain clearly excludes the shortest chain. However, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result during this, as it gives two chains of the same length. As a result, some actors may try to find a new block that refers to block BB11 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that refers to block CCC1 as its predecessor.
151	0.5172	Ambiguous common trunk. Applying a selection criterion does not always lead to a clear result. For example, in situations like the one in the first two situations above (shown here gaian) , there is more than one longest chain. In these situations, the blockchain has two paths of equal length starting from a common root. The common trunk consists of only two blocks that form a short chain A397 → 33FF. Later, the common trunk already consists of three blocks that form the chain AB12 → A397 → 33FF and contains the common trunk of the previous situation.
134	0.5125	Therefore, the idea arose to define a protocol for determining the valid transaction sequence based on the computational effort. Two criteria can be used for this: The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the heaviest chain
138	0.5036	As a result, the majority of actors have a blockchain, which now consists of two branches on a common trunk. In such a situation, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result, since both chains have the same length. Some actors may try to find a new block that points to block AB12 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that points to block DD01 as its predecessor.
144	0.4595	The longest chain (the path from root 33FF to leaf 0101) has a weight of 5, while the second longest chain (the path from root to leaf CCC1) has a weight of 6. Blockchains that include the level of difficulty use the criterion of the heaviest  chain, in this case the second chain is chosen.
142	0.4328	The criterion of the heaviest chain. Blockchain applications rarely use a consistent level of difficulty for the puzzle to be solved when a new block is to be added to the blockchain data structure. Instead, they usually determine the difficulty level dynamically, which distinguishes the blocks in terms of the computational effort spent on adding them to the blockchain.
142		Determining Validity: The Heaviest Chain Criterion in Dynamic Difficulty Blockchain
142	0.7543	The criterion of the heaviest chain. Blockchain applications rarely use a consistent level of difficulty for the puzzle to be solved when a new block is to be added to the blockchain data structure. Instead, they usually determine the difficulty level dynamically, which distinguishes the blocks in terms of the computational effort spent on adding them to the blockchain.
143	0.6206	The criterion of the longest chain is based on the idea that the path containing the most blocks represents the greatest computational effort. With heterogeneous difficulty levels, however, the longest path is not necessarily the one that represents the greatest computational effort. For each path, the computational effort required for this can be set to add up the difficulty of all associated blocks. This value can be calculated using the fact that the block header contains the difficulty level of its hash puzzle. The cumulative difficulty level of a path is often referred to as its weight.
154	0.5838	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
178	0.5574	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.
134	0.5359	Therefore, the idea arose to define a protocol for determining the valid transaction sequence based on the computational effort. Two criteria can be used for this: The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the heaviest chain
144	0.5306	The longest chain (the path from root 33FF to leaf 0101) has a weight of 5, while the second longest chain (the path from root to leaf CCC1) has a weight of 6.

135	0.5055	The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the longest chain is based on the idea that the blockchain data structure, which includes the most blocks, represents the greater computational effort. Let's look for a starting point in which all actors of a distributed system have agreed on the same version of an existing blockchain:
180	0.5007	Non-technical limitations of the blockchain. The main non-technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of legal recognition. Lack of user acceptance
169	0.4940	Technical limitations of the blockchain. The main technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of privacy; The Security Model; Limited scalability; High costs; Hidden centrality; Lack of flexibility; Critical size
140	0.4846	The result of incorporating these two new blocks into the blockchain is a data structure that contains three branches. One of the branches consists of only three blocks, while the other two consist of four blocks. The criterion of the longest chain clearly excludes the shortest chain. However, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result during this, as it gives two chains of the same length. As a result, some actors may try to find a new block that refers to block BB11 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that refers to block CCC1 as its predecessor.
143		Weighted Chains: Evaluating Computational Effort in Blockchain with the Criterion of Cumulative Difficulty
142	0.6807	The criterion of the heaviest chain. Blockchain applications rarely use a consistent level of difficulty for the puzzle to be solved when a new block is to be added to the blockchain data structure. Instead, they usually determine the difficulty level dynamically, which distinguishes the blocks in terms of the computational effort spent on adding them to the blockchain.

134	0.5278	Therefore, the idea arose to define a protocol for determining the valid transaction sequence based on the computational effort. Two criteria can be used for this: The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the heaviest chain
164	0.5242	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus. Permissionless or public blockchains offer a platform for new business models. However, by definition, they are based on a very computationally intensive computational model to ensure transaction integrity.
144	0.4986	The longest chain (the path from root 33FF to leaf 0101) has a weight of 5, while the second longest chain (the path from root to leaf CCC1) has a weight of 6. Blockchains that include the level of difficulty use the criterion of the heaviest  chain, in this case the second chain is chosen.
135	0.4967	The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the longest chain is based on the idea that the blockchain data structure, which includes the most blocks, represents the greater computational effort. Let's look for a starting point in which all actors of a distributed system have agreed on the same version of an existing blockchain:
169	0.4923	Technical limitations of the blockchain. The main technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of privacy; The Security Model; Limited scalability; High costs; Hidden centrality; Lack of flexibility; Critical size
175	0.4918	High costs. Solving the hash puzzle is intentionally computationally intensive. It is the security measure that makes the history of transaction data immutable. This proof is expensive. Thus, there are costs for the entire blockchain. The amount of these costs depends on the difficulty of the puzzles.
144		Heaviest Chain: Selecting Blockchain Paths based on Cumulative Difficulty
142	0.7074	The criterion of the heaviest chain. Blockchain applications rarely use a consistent level of difficulty for the puzzle to be solved when a new block is to be added to the blockchain data structure. Instead, they usually determine the difficulty level dynamically, which distinguishes the blocks in terms of the computational effort spent on adding them to the blockchain.

146	0.4720	Orphaned blocks. The growing blockchain looks like a tree whose branches reflect different versions of the transaction history. Applying a selection criterion (longest or heaviest chain) actually means selecting a path of that tree and setting it as the authoritative version of the transaction data history. All blocks in the tree-shaped data structure that are not part of the authorized path are abandoned by the actors and called orphaned blocks.
134	0.4716	Therefore, the idea arose to define a protocol for determining the valid transaction sequence based on the computational effort. Two criteria can be used for this: The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the heaviest chain
174	0.4675	Solving this puzzle is intentionally time-consuming. Insisting on solving the hash puzzle is one way to make the manipulation of the transaction history unjustifiably complex. Unfortunately, this security measure is accompanied by a reduced processing speed and thus a limited scalability. This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
178	0.4562	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.
145		Selecting a Chain: Consequences and Outcomes
145	0.6206	Following the selection of a chain. Selecting a particular chain from conflicting versions and determining it as the authoritative order has the following consequences: Orphaned blocks. Reclaimed renumeration. Clarification of ownership. Preparation of transactions. A growing common tribe. Robustness against manipulation
152	0.5162	Even if a selection criterion yields ambiguous results, the conflicting, versions of the transaction history result from a less ambiguous common root. The deeper the blockchain, the less ambiguous the decision as to which is the longest chain. Consider the situation where the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result: BB11 & CCC1 → AB12 & DD01 → A397 → 33FF. As we see in the next situation, the next block (0101) added to the blockchain determines whether block BB11 or CCC1 is either part of the longest chain or is abandoned instead. But who decides that the next block to be added to the blockchain will reference block BB11 as its predecessor and therefore to abandon block CCC1?
151	0.4588	Ambiguous common trunk. Applying a selection criterion does not always lead to a clear result. For example, in situations like the one in the first two situations above (shown here gaian) , there is more than one longest chain.

138	0.4528	As a result, the majority of actors have a blockchain, which now consists of two branches on a common trunk. In such a situation, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result, since both chains have the same length. Some actors may try to find a new block that points to block AB12 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that points to block DD01 as its predecessor.

All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.

144	0.3799	The longest chain (the path from root 33FF to leaf 0101) has a weight of 5, while the second longest chain (the path from root to leaf CCC1) has a weight of 6. Blockchains that include the level of difficulty use the criterion of the heaviest  chain, in this case the second chain is chosen.
146		Orphaned Blocks: Abandoned Paths in the Blockchain Tree
146	0.6325	Orphaned blocks. The growing blockchain looks like a tree whose branches reflect different versions of the transaction history. Applying a selection criterion (longest or heaviest chain) actually means selecting a path of that tree and setting it as the authoritative version of the transaction data history. All blocks in the tree-shaped data structure that are not part of the authorized path are abandoned by the actors and called orphaned blocks.
149	0.5978	Clarification of ownership. It is assumed that only transactions that are part of the authorized chain have taken place. Only they are used to clarify property-related claims. Orphaned blocks are not part of the collectively authorized chain. Therefore, they are treated as if they had never taken place, and they are considered not to have taken place in the settlement of property-related claims.
150	0.5854	Processing of orphaned transactions. Transaction data that are part of orphaned blocks was originally submitted with the goal of adding it to the transaction history. The fact that they are treated as if they never happened was never planned in advance. Rather, it is the result of the randomness of the proof of work and its role in building the blockchain. Transaction data that unfortunately ended up in orphaned blocks is given another chance to become part of the authorized transaction history by reprocessing it and later adding it to the blockchain.
148	0.5565	Reclaimed renumeration. Orphaned blocks are useless for the transfer of assets because they do not belong to an authorized chain. As a result, the remuneration is reclaimed by the actor who created and submitted it. If a block added to the blockchain is later identified as invalid or unusable, that block, as well as any subsequent blocks, will be logically removed from the blockchain and the compensation awarded for adding it will be reclaimed from the appropriate actor.
147	0.5536	For example, if the criterion of the longest chain is applied to the situation shown again in the previous slide, the blocks DD01 and CCC1 are not part of the longest chain and are abandoned. If the criterion of the heaviest chain is applied to the last situation shown here again, blocks 0101, BB11 and DD01 are not part of the authorized chain and are therefore abandoned.

Reclaimed renumeration. Clarification of ownership. Preparation of transactions. A growing common tribe. Robustness against manipulation
141	0.4416	Finally, a new block is entered, referring to block BB11 as its predecessor, resulting in the following blockchain. It contains many conflicting versions of the transaction history, but the criterion of the longest chain gives a clear result, namely the chain, which consists of blocks 0101 → BB11 → AB12 → A397 → 33FF. The majority of actors and eventually all actors in the system now use this chain to clarify ownership-related requirements that are mapped in transactions. They strive to expand this branch by finding a new block that points to block 0101 as its predecessor.
152	0.4245	Even if a selection criterion yields ambiguous results, the conflicting, versions of the transaction history result from a less ambiguous common root. The deeper the blockchain, the less ambiguous the decision as to which is the longest chain.

147		Abandoning Blocks: Selection Criteria in Blockchain Consensus
145	0.6129	Following the selection of a chain. Selecting a particular chain from conflicting versions and determining it as the authoritative order has the following consequences: Orphaned blocks.

146	0.5724	Orphaned blocks. The growing blockchain looks like a tree whose branches reflect different versions of the transaction history.

147	0.5289	For example, if the criterion of the longest chain is applied to the situation shown again in the previous slide, the blocks DD01 and CCC1 are not part of the longest chain and are abandoned. If the criterion of the heaviest chain is applied to the last situation shown here again, blocks 0101, BB11 and DD01 are not part of the authorized chain and are therefore abandoned.
33	0.4909	Choosing the consensus algorithm to use is perhaps the most important aspect when choosing a blockchain platform. There are five standard methods to reach consensus. In general, public platforms choose algorithms such as Proof of Work because they require a lot of computing power for computation and are easy to verify for the network nodes involved. Proof-of-Work (PoW). Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm (PBFT). Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Proof-of-Authority (PoA). Proof-of-Honesty (PoH)
65	0.4760	Add a new transaction to the ledgers.

It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
19	0.4698	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
28	0.4657	After a block is added, it can be referenced in subsequent blocks, but cannot be changed. When someone tries to exchange a block or change information stored in it, the hashes for previous and subsequent blocks also change and change the shared state of the blockchain. When consensus is no longer possible, all other nodes on the network are aware that a problem has occurred, and no new blocks are added to the blockchain until the problem is resolved. Typically, the block that caused the problems is discarded and the consensus process is repeated.
43	0.4560	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
178	0.4500	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.
148		Reclaimed Remuneration: Handling Invalid Blocks in Blockchain
148	0.6851	Reclaimed renumeration. Orphaned blocks are useless for the transfer of assets because they do not belong to an authorized chain. As a result, the remuneration is reclaimed by the actor who created and submitted it. If a block added to the blockchain is later identified as invalid or unusable, that block, as well as any subsequent blocks, will be logically removed from the blockchain and the compensation awarded for adding it will be reclaimed from the appropriate actor.

Transaction data that unfortunately ended up in orphaned blocks is given another chance to become part of the authorized transaction history by reprocessing it and later adding it to the blockchain.
240	0.4508	While most experts agree that blockchain will eventually be used by human resources for hiring and administrative purposes, the use of blockchains is not yet in sight here. In contrast to financial applications, recruitment, CVs or job histories do not yet have use cases that credibly demonstrate trustworthy use in the management of histories. This means that the use of blockchain technology will initially be limited to the review and documentation of education and training.
62	0.4459	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
42	0.4324	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
61	0.4307	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
236	0.4306	For the blockchain to undeniably reflect a resume or employment history, the question of who brings the data into each block and who verifies the data is crucial. In some use cases, such as review of financial statements, the answers to these questions are relatively simple. Schools and universities could already make data blocks available to their students in which information on the respective educational path and the achievements achieved are documented. In a blockchain world, the transcripts, certificates, and testimonials would be tamper-proof and basically signed by the issuing institution.
56	0.4262	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
65	0.4258	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
149		Clarification of Ownership: Valid Transactions in the Authorized Chain
111	0.7102	By signing and verifying transactions, the transfer of ownership in blockchain is authorized.
149	0.5852	Clarification of ownership. It is assumed that only transactions that are part of the authorized chain have taken place. Only they are used to clarify property-related claims. Orphaned blocks are not part of the collectively authorized chain. Therefore, they are treated as if they had never taken place, and they are considered not to have taken place in the settlement of property-related claims.
57	0.5702	The assignment between owners and objects is usually done via a general ledger or register. A ledger  is a concrete implementation of an assignment between owners  and property. Proof of ownership requires the identification of owners and property, as well as the assignment between owners and property. The use of the property requires identification as well as authentication and authorization to ensure that only the legitimate person  legally owns the property.
104	0.5698	The blockchain must ensure that only the owner of one account can transfer the associated asset to other accounts. The transfer of ownership is based on a digital security measure corresponding to the handwritten signature and serves the same purpose: Identify an account, Instruction of the owner, which relating to the content of the corresponding transaction and Approval of the execution by adding the data to its transaction history.
94	0.5684	The blockchain must uniquely identify participants and assets and ensure that only the rightful owner can access their property. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system that is open to all. Anyone can connect and provision computing resources or send new transaction data to the system. However, it is not desirable for everyone to access the asset that is assigned to the account managed by the blockchain. An essential feature of private property is its exclusivity. The right to transfer ownership to another account is limited to the owner of the account who hands over ownership.
67	0.5540	Description of the transfer of ownership. A transaction is the transfer of ownership from one owner to another. The act of transfer of ownership is documented with the following facts: Creation of the owner's account. Name of the account to which ownership is to be transferred. Quantity and scope of the property to be transferred.
56	0.5376	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
70	0.5371	The complete history of transaction data is a process chain that provides information about how people acquired and transferred ownership. Any transaction that is not part of this history is considered as if it never happened. A transaction is executed by adding it to the history of the transaction data. The order in which transaction data is added to the history must be preserved. Only transaction data that meets the following three criteria are added to the Blockchain: Formal correctness. Semantic correctness. Authorization
62	0.5364	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
182	0.5297	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system. Those who have witnessed the emergence and development of the Internet may see a similarity between the legal status of today's blockchain and the lack of legal acceptance of e-commerce in the nineties.
150		Processing Orphaned Transactions: Giving Another Chance to Unconfirmed Data
150	0.6478	Processing of orphaned transactions. Transaction data that are part of orphaned blocks was originally submitted with the goal of adding it to the transaction history. The fact that they are treated as if they never happened was never planned in advance. Rather, it is the result of the randomness of the proof of work and its role in building the blockchain. Transaction data that unfortunately ended up in orphaned blocks is given another chance to become part of the authorized transaction history by reprocessing it and later adding it to the blockchain.
116	0.4842	The challenge is to store all transaction data that has ever taken place in such a way that the order in which the transactions took place is preserved and changes to the data are detected quickly and easily. The rapid detection of changes is important to prevent manipulation of the transaction history.
187	0.4265	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.
189	0.4241	The exact temporal assignment (time stamp) and the immutability of the transaction data is an important aspect of blockchains. Once stored, data can no longer be changed. This can be a problem if the General Data Protection Regulation gives users the right to be forgotten and all of a user's personal data must be deleted. Any design of a blockchain that is contrary to legal regulations is automatically doomed to failure. In the present case, it makes sense to separate the personal data from the actual transaction data via a link.
70	0.4230	The complete history of transaction data is a process chain that provides information about how people acquired and transferred ownership. Any transaction that is not part of this history is considered as if it never happened. A transaction is executed by adding it to the history of the transaction data. The order in which transaction data is added to the history must be preserved. Only transaction data that meets the following three criteria are added to the Blockchain: Formal correctness. Semantic correctness. Authorization
5	0.4032	Transaction data is information about transactions. They usually refer to the time of the transaction, the participants executing or affecting the transaction, and the things or assets to which the transaction relates. A transaction can be considered as a sequence of an exchange of information for a specific purpose (e.g. sale of a bond). The exchange of information is considered a closed unit. Transaction data can be financial, logistical, or production-related in nature and can relate to a purchase, delivery status, hours worked, insurance premium, or claim.
129	0.3989	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
117	0.3655	How to detect the manipulation of a transaction? Changing data anywhere on the blockchain requires the renewal of all hash references, starting with the one that directly references the manipulated data and ending with the head of the entire blockchain as well as all hash references in between.
148	0.3626	Reclaimed renumeration. Orphaned blocks are useless for the transfer of assets because they do not belong to an authorized chain. As a result, the remuneration is reclaimed by the actor who created and submitted it. If a block added to the blockchain is later identified as invalid or unusable, that block, as well as any subsequent blocks, will be logically removed from the blockchain and the compensation awarded for adding it will be reclaimed from the appropriate actor.
149	0.3548	Clarification of ownership. It is assumed that only transactions that are part of the authorized chain have taken place. Only they are used to clarify property-related claims. Orphaned blocks are not part of the collectively authorized chain. Therefore, they are treated as if they had never taken place, and they are considered not to have taken place in the settlement of property-related claims.
151		Ambiguous Common Trunk: Multiple Longest Chains in Blockchain
151	0.7394	Ambiguous common trunk. Applying a selection criterion does not always lead to a clear result. For example, in situations like the one in the first two situations above (shown here gaian) , there is more than one longest chain. In these situations, the blockchain has two paths of equal length starting from a common root. The common trunk consists of only two blocks that form a short chain A397 → 33FF. Later, the common trunk already consists of three blocks that form the chain AB12 → A397 → 33FF and contains the common trunk of the previous situation.
140	0.6633	The result of incorporating these two new blocks into the blockchain is a data structure that contains three branches. One of the branches consists of only three blocks, while the other two consist of four blocks. The criterion of the longest chain clearly excludes the shortest chain. However, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result during this, as it gives two chains of the same length. As a result, some actors may try to find a new block that refers to block BB11 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that refers to block CCC1 as its predecessor.
138	0.6497	As a result, the majority of actors have a blockchain, which now consists of two branches on a common trunk. In such a situation, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result, since both chains have the same length. Some actors may try to find a new block that points to block AB12 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that points to block DD01 as its predecessor.
135	0.5922	The criterion of the longest chain. The criterion of the longest chain is based on the idea that the blockchain data structure, which includes the most blocks, represents the greater computational effort. Let's look for a starting point in which all actors of a distributed system have agreed on the same version of an existing blockchain:
144	0.5698	The longest chain (the path from root 33FF to leaf 0101) has a weight of 5, while the second longest chain (the path from root to leaf CCC1) has a weight of 6. Blockchains that include the level of difficulty use the criterion of the heaviest  chain, in this case the second chain is chosen.
152	0.5368	Even if a selection criterion yields ambiguous results, the conflicting, versions of the transaction history result from a less ambiguous common root. The deeper the blockchain, the less ambiguous the decision as to which is the longest chain. Consider the situation where the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result: BB11 & CCC1 → AB12 & DD01 → A397 → 33FF. As we see in the next situation, the next block (0101) added to the blockchain determines whether block BB11 or CCC1 is either part of the longest chain or is abandoned instead. But who decides that the next block to be added to the blockchain will reference block BB11 as its predecessor and therefore to abandon block CCC1?
141	0.5262	Finally, a new block is entered, referring to block BB11 as its predecessor, resulting in the following blockchain. It contains many conflicting versions of the transaction history, but the criterion of the longest chain gives a clear result, namely the chain, which consists of blocks 0101 → BB11 → AB12 → A397 → 33FF. The majority of actors and eventually all actors in the system now use this chain to clarify ownership-related requirements that are mapped in transactions. They strive to expand this branch by finding a new block that points to block 0101 as its predecessor.
147	0.5007	For example, if the criterion of the longest chain is applied to the situation shown again in the previous slide, the blocks DD01 and CCC1 are not part of the longest chain and are abandoned. If the criterion of the heaviest chain is applied to the last situation shown here again, blocks 0101, BB11 and DD01 are not part of the authorized chain and are therefore abandoned.
145	0.4978	Following the selection of a chain. Selecting a particular chain from conflicting versions and determining it as the authoritative order has the following consequences: Orphaned blocks. Reclaimed renumeration. Clarification of ownership. Preparation of transactions. A growing common tribe. Robustness against manipulation
65	0.4879	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
152		Determining the Next Block: Decision-Making in Blockchain
65	0.5317	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
136	0.5196	Each of the boxes represents a block marked with a shortened hash value. The arrow pointing from one box to another represents the hash reference that links a block header to its predecessor. In this initial situation, all actors agree on a history of the transaction data and strive for an extension of the existing chain by another block, which refers to block A397 as its predecessor. If a transaction is now proposed for accounting, a new block is written for the blockchain. The following order is the one that the majority of actors will find once the new block has been added.
140	0.5004	The result of incorporating these two new blocks into the blockchain is a data structure that contains three branches. One of the branches consists of only three blocks, while the other two consist of four blocks. The criterion of the longest chain clearly excludes the shortest chain. However, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result during this, as it gives two chains of the same length. As a result, some actors may try to find a new block that refers to block BB11 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that refers to block CCC1 as its predecessor.

Reclaimed renumeration. Clarification of ownership. Preparation of transactions. A growing common tribe. Robustness against manipulation
178	0.4844	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.
129	0.4821	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
146	0.4767	Orphaned blocks. The growing blockchain looks like a tree whose branches reflect different versions of the transaction history. Applying a selection criterion (longest or heaviest chain) actually means selecting a path of that tree and setting it as the authoritative version of the transaction data history. All blocks in the tree-shaped data structure that are not part of the authorized path are abandoned by the actors and called orphaned blocks.
152	0.4702	Even if a selection criterion yields ambiguous results, the conflicting, versions of the transaction history result from a less ambiguous common root. The deeper the blockchain, the less ambiguous the decision as to which is the longest chain. Consider the situation where the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result: BB11 & CCC1 → AB12 & DD01 → A397 → 33FF. As we see in the next situation, the next block (0101) added to the blockchain determines whether block BB11 or CCC1 is either part of the longest chain or is abandoned instead. But who decides that the next block to be added to the blockchain will reference block BB11 as its predecessor and therefore to abandon block CCC1?
168	0.4688	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
141	0.4683	Finally, a new block is entered, referring to block BB11 as its predecessor, resulting in the following blockchain. It contains many conflicting versions of the transaction history, but the criterion of the longest chain gives a clear result, namely the chain, which consists of blocks 0101 → BB11 → AB12 → A397 → 33FF. The majority of actors and eventually all actors in the system now use this chain to clarify ownership-related requirements that are mapped in transactions. They strive to expand this branch by finding a new block that points to block 0101 as its predecessor.
153		Actor's Decision: Influencing Blockchain Branches
128	0.5975	The protocol of the accounting takes into account that some actors are honest and follow the protocol, while others are dishonest and deviate from the protocol, as in real life, when many people participate in a common cause. A blockchain is open to any actor. But even if it weren't open to every actor, we can't assume that we can trust everyone in the user community. The protective mechanism that offers itself here is to make any kind of manipulation immensely complex.
181	0.5899	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
126	0.5704	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
168	0.5479	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
182	0.5399	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system. Those who have witnessed the emergence and development of the Internet may see a similarity between the legal status of today's blockchain and the lack of legal acceptance of e-commerce in the nineties.
170	0.5362	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.
180	0.5345	Non-technical limitations of the blockchain. The main non-technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of legal recognition. Lack of user acceptance
154	0.5326	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
159	0.5269	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
138	0.5256	As a result, the majority of actors have a blockchain, which now consists of two branches on a common trunk. In such a situation, the criterion of the longest chain does not give a clear result, since both chains have the same length. Some actors may try to find a new block that points to block AB12 as its predecessor, while other actors may try to find a new block that points to block DD01 as its predecessor.

As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
163	0.5631	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
43	0.5495	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
179	0.5432	Critical size. The robustness against manipulation and thus the trustworthiness of the collectively maintained transaction data history is based on the assumption that the majority of the computing power of the system is controlled by honest actors. However, in small peer-to-peer systems with limited computing power, this majority can still be very small, which in turn could allow a 51 percent attack to be carried out.
166	0.5395	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
42	0.5382	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
51	0.5367	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
164	0.5343	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus. Permissionless or public blockchains offer a platform for new business models. However, by definition, they are based on a very computationally intensive computational model to ensure transaction integrity.
61	0.5131	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
49	0.5084	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
155		Resistance to Attack: Majority Computing Power in Blockchain Security
179	0.5368	Critical size. The robustness against manipulation and thus the trustworthiness of the collectively maintained transaction data history is based on the assumption that the majority of the computing power of the system is controlled by honest actors. However, in small peer-to-peer systems with limited computing power, this majority can still be very small, which in turn could allow a 51 percent attack to be carried out.
217	0.5282	They can recognize the re-registration of long-standing passive network participants as trusted members. Blockchain can support the growth and development of IoT, including fraud management, identity management, authentication, authorization, billing, and audits. The sheer volume dimension of IoT creates new management problems that existing systems have not yet faced. Automating many, if not all, aspects of operations will be crucial, and blockchain is well positioned to take on critical roles here.

156	0.5154	However, it is impossible for any attacker who has less computing power than the majority to take a new path, catching up with and overtaking the path taken by the majority. Therefore, any attempt to set up a new authorized path that contains fraudulent transactions will be overtaken and rejected by the path maintained by the honest majority. As a result, the history of transactions managed by the system is robust against manipulation.

In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
157		Exploring Design Parameters and Application Perspectives in Blockchain Technology
157	0.7163	The smart contract is the essential core of a blockchain. It determines which actors are involved in which transactions and how, and regulates how the transfer of property, information, etc. takes place. This chapter explains some design parameters that should be considered when developing blockchain applications (public versus private blockchain, transparency versus privacy, and a few more). A small case study explains the design of a blockchain application. Application examples and design sketches show how this still young technology is currently being implemented in practice and which application perspectives already exist.
211	0.6578	Basically, the following steps should be considered when designing a blockchain application: Description of the essential use cases and their mapping in a technology development plan. Presentation of a proof of concept. Performing tests initially with limited functionality, but which offer a certain user experience. Later, more data and more interaction are underpinned. Complete rollout of the production system.
168	0.6480	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
178	0.6317	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.
34	0.6178	The areas of application are manifold and can certainly not be described conclusively here. Much of the early interest in blockchain technology arose around its application in financial transactions. This is understandable when you consider that the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been used worldwide, proving that blockchain technology can actually work. Banks and other financially relevant institutions have also become early innovators in this area. Other industries, including healthcare, the public sector, agriculture, energy, and many more, are exploring how they can use blockchain to enable the secure exchange of data such as personal health information, digital assets, or real estate data.
1	0.6155	There are many misleading stories about blockchain. Much of the stories are about cryptocurrencies that led to incredible wealth or nightmare losses, or form the basis for a new financial system that supports dark markets for weapons or drugs. Blockchain is also considered a technology with enormous energy requirements. The variety of design and application possibilities of this technology and the opportunities thvat result from it are omitted from these stories.
37	0.6066	For a company, blockchain offers the following basic possibilities: A design approach that keeps transaction data, value, and status inherently close to business logic. The necessary data schemas for transactional data are easier to manage. Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.
42	0.5901	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
206	0.5601	General design aspects. Blockchain technology was initially taken up by the financial industry. Above all, however, new players were pushing into the market. It was also the intention of Bitcoin to establish an alternative to existing processes in banking. Banks carry out intensive account reconciliations for transfers, which are triggered in batch mode at the end of the day. Therefore, a transfer from one customer to another a few days and longer if it is an international transfer. In addition, absurdly high fees are sometimes charged, especially for international money transfers.
40	0.5566	Articles in the press have questioned whether blockchain technologies, as they exist now, are sufficiently reliable to deploy on a large scale. Topics include the lack of regulations for this new form of exchange and safety concerns. Blockchains are usually associated with digital currencies such as Bitcoin or alternative versions. However, the fact is that blockchain applications are being researched in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all kinds.
158		Building Trust and Transparency with Blockchain Technology
184	0.6675	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
183	0.6468	Lack of user acceptance. Blockchain faces two conflicts: Transparency vs. data protection and Security vs. Speed
42	0.6409	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
19	0.6384	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
170	0.6198	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.
157	0.6087	The smart contract is the essential core of a blockchain. It determines which actors are involved in which transactions and how, and regulates how the transfer of property, information, etc. takes place. This chapter explains some design parameters that should be considered when developing blockchain applications (public versus private blockchain, transparency versus privacy, and a few more). A small case study explains the design of a blockchain application. Application examples and design sketches show how this still young technology is currently being implemented in practice and which application perspectives already exist.
159	0.6079	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
215	0.6058	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
46	0.5882	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
229	0.5798	Systems for tracking products in the recyclable materials chain Companies can use IoT sensors and blockchain to show that they meet compliance requirements or customs regulations through the traceability of their products. One of the challenges in compliance is transparency in traceability. Blockchain makes it easier to implement traceability. For example, there is a world health organization guide on good distribution practices for the distribution of pharmaceutical products.
159		Revolutionizing Trust and Collaboration with Blockchain Technology
159	0.6302	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events.

This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
126	0.6101	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
217	0.6038	They can recognize the re-registration of long-standing passive network participants as trusted members. Blockchain can support the growth and development of IoT, including fraud management, identity management, authentication, authorization, billing, and audits. The sheer volume dimension of IoT creates new management problems that existing systems have not yet faced. Automating many, if not all, aspects of operations will be crucial, and blockchain is well positioned to take on critical roles here.
42	0.5990	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
51	0.5784	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.

Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
163	0.5532	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
3	0.5408	Strictly speaking, blockchain and distributed technology is less a technology itself, but rather a technology group that can be characterized, at least from an algorithmic point of view, via a protocol of chaining, distribution, and consensus. The basic principles have been known for a long time and have also been used in the context of public data security.
160		Empowering Transactions with Smart Contracts
64	0.5216	Design of ledgers for distributed and untrusted environments. The best way to prevent the transaction history from being changed is to make it immutable. This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.
215	0.5180	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders.

Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
207	0.5107	With a blockchain in which all financial actors are involved, a money transfer can be executed in seconds, at almost disappearing transaction costs. However, there are other sectors that are also using blockchain in the meantime, such as healthcare, energy, human resources, real estate trading, education and others. A variety of industries could benefit from the use of smart contracts that control supply chains and record the corresponding transactions on a blockchain.
228	0.5048	The advantage of a blockchain solution lies in the creation of a uniform information on the status of asylum procedures that crosses the organization. This level of information is visible, comprehensible and cannot be manipulated by all authorities involved and forms the basis for improving process integrity. Smart contracts can also support the management of these processes and enable the establishment of an inter-agency process management system in the future. In addition, a blockchain solution can support decentralized data storage and thus contribute in particular to the data sovereignty of the individual authorities.
116	0.5039	The challenge is to store all transaction data that has ever taken place in such a way that the order in which the transactions took place is preserved and changes to the data are detected quickly and easily. The rapid detection of changes is important to prevent manipulation of the transaction history.
208	0.4976	Automating healthcare payment processes using smart contracts can prevent incorrect payments and fraud. The music industry could include the intellectual property of music or videos on the blockchain and then define a smart contract to ensure that royalties are paid when the music is used for commercial purposes. Smart contracts and blockchain could benefit the automotive industry by storing easily accessible information about vehicle maintenance and accident and ownership history.
160	0.4974	A smart contract is a computer protocol that determines interactions between actors in any type of blockchain. It sets out the rules and conditions under which a transaction or exchange is considered valid.

Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.
187	0.4908	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.

160	0.5541	A smart contract is a computer protocol that determines interactions between actors in any type of blockchain. It sets out the rules and conditions under which a transaction or exchange is considered valid.
161	0.5250	From a legal point of view, a smart contract is not necessarily a contract consisting of two corresponding declarations of intent (offer and acceptance of the offer). A smart contract, on the other hand, is merely a software-based protocol that entails other agreed protocol steps when a previously defined condition occurs. Actually, a smart contract is a process for documenting a contract. One of the essential characteristics of smart contracts is the unstoppability of once programmed processes after conditions have occurred.
182	0.5185	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system. Those who have witnessed the emergence and development of the Internet may see a similarity between the legal status of today's blockchain and the lack of legal acceptance of e-commerce in the nineties.

218	0.4945	Many IoT use cases include, for example, the fast communication setup between several business partners. This communication must implement legal and financial actions, regulated in service level agreements (SLAs). By using smart contracts over the blockchain, defined by trusted actors, participants in a system can be sure that objective information is provided and SLAs are continuously monitored. Other use cases for blockchain in the IoT would concern device identity. Is a particular device authorized to act as an actor in the network or has it been noticed in the past by negative behavior.
180	0.4870	Non-technical limitations of the blockchain. The main non-technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of legal recognition. Lack of user acceptance

However, there are other sectors that are also using blockchain in the meantime, such as healthcare, energy, human resources, real estate trading, education and others. A variety of industries could benefit from the use of smart contracts that control supply chains and record the corresponding transactions on a blockchain.
209	0.4632	Smart contracts can enable microtransactions for different types of billing. For example, they could be used in a digital wallet to control expenses: you can give your son €20 in the digital wallet with the condition that the money cannot be spent on fast food and on cinema tickets only if the screening does not take place in the afternoon, when he should actually do his homework.
228	0.4598	The advantage of a blockchain solution lies in the creation of a uniform information on the status of asylum procedures that crosses the organization.

162		Public vs Private Blockchain: Choosing the Right Path
162	0.6921	Public versus private blockchain. Distinguishing between a public blockchain system (without access permissions) and a private (permissoned) blockchain system (with access authorization), where participants have reliable identities and only verified members of the network can participate, is crucial to designing a blockchain application. Private blockchains are better suited for business applications, especially in regulated industries, such as the financial or energy sectors. They are based on customer knowledge and regulatory requirements. The lack of complicated PoW makes private blockchains less energy-intensive.
184	0.5487	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all.

43	0.5369	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.

188	0.5209	Decision on transparency vs. data protection. When you make a decision about the conflict between transparency and privacy, you need to decide who you want to give read access to. If only extreme cases where read access is granted are considered, there are two options: grant read access to everyone or grant read access to only a limited group of actors. · Public blockchains grant all actors read access and the right to create new transactions. · Private blockchains restrict read access and the right to record new transactions to a select group of actors.

164		Identity and Consensus: The Role of Actors in Blockchain Trust Models
126	0.7587	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.

128	0.6019	The protocol of the accounting takes into account that some actors are honest and follow the protocol, while others are dishonest and deviate from the protocol, as in real life, when many people participate in a common cause. A blockchain is open to any actor. But even if it weren't open to every actor, we can't assume that we can trust everyone in the user community. The protective mechanism that offers itself here is to make any kind of manipulation immensely complex.
171	0.5979	The Security Model. The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to identify and authenticate actors and authorize transactions. Account numbers on the blockchain are actually public cryptographic keys. Only the person who has the appropriate private key can access the property associated with an account. Only transaction data that contains a digital signature created with the appropriate private key is valid and can transfer ownership from one account to another.

168	0.5923	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
163	0.5919	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
215	0.5900	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
42	0.5804	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
19	0.5793	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
165		Clearing House: Mitigating Trust Issues in the Banking Sector
165	0.5589	Example from the financial sector: The establishment of the clearing house in the banking sector was created because banks do not fully trust each other, thus reducing the risk of an actor not complying with its conditions between transactions.
128	0.4385	The protocol of the accounting takes into account that some actors are honest and follow the protocol, while others are dishonest and deviate from the protocol, as in real life, when many people participate in a common cause. A blockchain is open to any actor. But even if it weren't open to every actor, we can't assume that we can trust everyone in the user community. The protective mechanism that offers itself here is to make any kind of manipulation immensely complex.
159	0.4368	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
52	0.4145	The problem of achieving and maintaining integrity and trust in a system consisting of an unknown number of members with unknown trustworthiness is well known and widely used in computer science. It is called the problem of Byzantine generals.
56	0.4121	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
49	0.4041	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
126	0.4040	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
42	0.4033	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.

Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
179	0.4015	Critical size. The robustness against manipulation and thus the trustworthiness of the collectively maintained transaction data history is based on the assumption that the majority of the computing power of the system is controlled by honest actors. However, in small peer-to-peer systems with limited computing power, this majority can still be very small, which in turn could allow a 51 percent attack to be carried out.
166		Efficient and Secure: Proof-of-Authority (PoA) Consensus Mechanism
166	0.7678	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
167	0.6091	Proof-of-Stake (PoS): is a similar approach that does not require mining. The authorizations for transaction handling are assigned randomly. For example, an actor can be randomly selected to process transactions in a 60-second window before randomly selecting a new actor. Proof-of-honesty (PoH): is an approach similar to PoA, but the authority is placed on a small circle of honest actors who assign the permissions to handle transactions among themselves. 
33	0.5519	Choosing the consensus algorithm to use is perhaps the most important aspect when choosing a blockchain platform. There are five standard methods to reach consensus. In general, public platforms choose algorithms such as Proof of Work because they require a lot of computing power for computation and are easy to verify for the network nodes involved. Proof-of-Work (PoW). Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm (PBFT). Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Proof-of-Authority (PoA). Proof-of-Honesty (PoH)
126	0.4997	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
213	0.4851	The consensus algorithm contains the so-called trilemma: security, scalability and decentralization. In order to increase scalability and also the processing speed in a blockchain, security must be reduced (transition from PoW to PoS, for example) or decentralization (PoA). Processing speed is a serious problem with blockchains. Bitcoin, for example, creates a throughput of seven transactions per second. Visa's system comes to about 1700 transactions per second with central data storage. This means that blockchains are only accepted if there are no significant differences in performance to central systems.
214	0.4704	PoS makes it possible to get transactions booked at a greater speed than PoW. However, this consensus mechanism is more susceptible to external attacks. PoA also accelerates consensus, but limits the handling of transactions to a select group of actors. Basically, legitimate blockchains offer faster and more efficient processing, but at the expense of the public and democratic nature of the blockchain. At the same time, they are more suitable for use in companies.
22	0.4610	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
44	0.4443	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
197	0.4438	At every stage, Alice’s supply-chain blockchain includes identities and access control. The temperature sensors sign their votes, so voter fraud is impossible. Only Alice, Bob, Carl, and the sensors have permission to write to the record list, so it is possible to hold participants accountable if someone tries to tamper with the ledger. In this distributed data storage, a linked list serves as a ledger and a combination of fault-tolerant Byzantine votes and human signatures serves as a consensus. The principle of ledger plus consensus is essential in blockchains.
154	0.4426	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
167		Efficient and Trustworthy: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Honesty (PoH) Consensus Mechanisms
167	0.7695	Proof-of-Stake (PoS): is a similar approach that does not require mining. The authorizations for transaction handling are assigned randomly. For example, an actor can be randomly selected to process transactions in a 60-second window before randomly selecting a new actor.

The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
50	0.5449	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.

157	0.5499	The smart contract is the essential core of a blockchain. It determines which actors are involved in which transactions and how, and regulates how the transfer of property, information, etc. takes place. This chapter explains some design parameters that should be considered when developing blockchain applications (public versus private blockchain, transparency versus privacy, and a few more). A small case study explains the design of a blockchain application. Application examples and design sketches show how this still young technology is currently being implemented in practice and which application perspectives already exist.
178	0.5463	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.
181	0.5360	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
164	0.5340	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus.

43	0.5277	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
163	0.5073	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity.

As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
169		Technical Limitations of the Blockchain: Privacy, Security, Scalability, Cost, Centralization, Flexibility, Critical Size
169	0.8716	Technical limitations of the blockchain. The main technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of privacy; The Security Model; Limited scalability; High costs; Hidden centrality; Lack of flexibility; Critical size
180	0.7416	Non-technical limitations of the blockchain. The main non-technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of legal recognition. Lack of user acceptance

On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
173	0.6364	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
170	0.6351	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.
183	0.6227	Lack of user acceptance. Blockchain faces two conflicts: Transparency vs. data protection and Security vs. Speed
162	0.6134	Public versus private blockchain. Distinguishing between a public blockchain system (without access permissions) and a private (permissoned) blockchain system (with access authorization), where participants have reliable identities and only verified members of the network can participate, is crucial to designing a blockchain application. Private blockchains are better suited for business applications, especially in regulated industries, such as the financial or energy sectors. They are based on customer knowledge and regulatory requirements. The lack of complicated PoW makes private blockchains less energy-intensive.
40	0.5894	Articles in the press have questioned whether blockchain technologies, as they exist now, are sufficiently reliable to deploy on a large scale. Topics include the lack of regulations for this new form of exchange and safety concerns. Blockchains are usually associated with digital currencies such as Bitcoin or alternative versions. However, the fact is that blockchain applications are being researched in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all kinds.

103	0.6204	The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to achieve two goals: Identify accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys. Authorize transactions: The owner of the account that hands over ownership creates an encrypted text with the corresponding private key. This encrypted text can be validated using the appropriate public key. This is the number of the account that hands over ownership.

171	0.5723	The Security Model. The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to identify and authenticate actors and authorize transactions. Account numbers on the blockchain are actually public cryptographic keys. Only the person who has the appropriate private key can access the property associated with an account. Only transaction data that contains a digital signature created with the appropriate private key is valid and can transfer ownership from one account to another.

94	0.5918	The blockchain must uniquely identify participants and assets and ensure that only the rightful owner can access their property. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system that is open to all. Anyone can connect and provision computing resources or send new transaction data to the system. However, it is not desirable for everyone to access the asset that is assigned to the account managed by the blockchain. An essential feature of private property is its exclusivity. The right to transfer ownership to another account is limited to the owner of the account who hands over ownership.
43	0.5636	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
42	0.5572	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
215	0.5570	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
56	0.5569	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
163	0.5539	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
51	0.5515	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
166	0.5445	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
162	0.5423	Public versus private blockchain. Distinguishing between a public blockchain system (without access permissions) and a private (permissoned) blockchain system (with access authorization), where participants have reliable identities and only verified members of the network can participate, is crucial to designing a blockchain application. Private blockchains are better suited for business applications, especially in regulated industries, such as the financial or energy sectors. They are based on customer knowledge and regulatory requirements. The lack of complicated PoW makes private blockchains less energy-intensive.
173		Challenges of Scalability in Blockchain Technology
173	0.6523	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
169	0.6479	Technical limitations of the blockchain. The main technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of privacy; The Security Model; Limited scalability; High costs; Hidden centrality; Lack of flexibility; Critical size
178	0.6389	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.
40	0.5957	Articles in the press have questioned whether blockchain technologies, as they exist now, are sufficiently reliable to deploy on a large scale. Topics include the lack of regulations for this new form of exchange and safety concerns. Blockchains are usually associated with digital currencies such as Bitcoin or alternative versions. However, the fact is that blockchain applications are being researched in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all kinds.
19	0.5861	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
180	0.5775	Non-technical limitations of the blockchain. The main non-technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of legal recognition. Lack of user acceptance
129	0.5503	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
168	0.5466	Design parameters for a blockchain system A blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system where any actor can read the transaction history and add new transaction data to the collectively managed ledger. The openness and lack of any form of central control and coordination are the basis of the system. They enable the actors on the Internet to act as independent witnesses to clarify property issues.
213	0.5462	The consensus algorithm contains the so-called trilemma: security, scalability and decentralization. In order to increase scalability and also the processing speed in a blockchain, security must be reduced (transition from PoW to PoS, for example) or decentralization (PoA). Processing speed is a serious problem with blockchains. Bitcoin, for example, creates a throughput of seven transactions per second. Visa's system comes to about 1700 transactions per second with central data storage. This means that blockchains are only accepted if there are no significant differences in performance to central systems.
42	0.5442	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements.

61	0.5240	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
22	0.5207	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
175		The Cost Factor in Blockchain: Balancing Security and Efficiency
43	0.5576	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs.

Unfortunately, this security measure is accompanied by a reduced processing speed and thus a limited scalability. This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
46	0.5120	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
159	0.4979	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
175	0.4948	High costs. Solving the hash puzzle is intentionally computationally intensive. It is the security measure that makes the history of transaction data immutable. This proof is expensive. Thus, there are costs for the entire blockchain. The amount of these costs depends on the difficulty of the puzzles.
173	0.4939	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification.

39	0.4937	Experts cite several important benefits for using blockchain. Security is considered one of the main advantages of this technology. It is almost impossible to manipulate a blockchain because information from thousands, even millions of computers, is shared and constantly compared with each other. In addition, blockchain does not have a singular point of failure. If one node fails, this is not a problem because all other nodes have a copy of the ledger. Whether blockchain will revolutionize the way public administration, institutions and industries work is an open question.
176		Unveiling Hidden Centrality in Blockchain: From Democracy to Concentration of Computing Power
176	0.7419	Hidden centrality. The need to solve a puzzle for each block added to the blockchain data structure, and the rules for distributing rewards that contribute to the integrity of the system, lead to an arms race between actors in terms of their computing power. The supposedly large and democratic group of actors who together maintain the integrity of the system eventually become a very small group of actors who have enormous computing power, often in the form of specialized hardware.
19	0.5708	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
170	0.5184	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.

This image often rubs off on blockchain technology in general.
3	0.4979	Strictly speaking, blockchain and distributed technology is less a technology itself, but rather a technology group that can be characterized, at least from an algorithmic point of view, via a protocol of chaining, distribution, and consensus. The basic principles have been known for a long time and have also been used in the context of public data security.

On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
179	0.4809	Critical size. The robustness against manipulation and thus the trustworthiness of the collectively maintained transaction data history is based on the assumption that the majority of the computing power of the system is controlled by honest actors. However, in small peer-to-peer systems with limited computing power, this majority can still be very small, which in turn could allow a 51 percent attack to be carried out.
1	0.4670	There are many misleading stories about blockchain. Much of the stories are about cryptocurrencies that led to incredible wealth or nightmare losses, or form the basis for a new financial system that supports dark markets for weapons or drugs. Blockchain is also considered a technology with enormous energy requirements. The variety of design and application possibilities of this technology and the opportunities thvat result from it are omitted from these stories.
8	0.4658	There are carefully monitored and closed systems in which only privileged users are allowed to make entries. For example, when a customer transfers money from one bank account to another, they ask the bank to do so on their behalf instead of dealing directly with the bank's transaction system. Centralization is associated with the paradigm of central control. This has other implications. A central system is a system that, by definition, has a critical source of failure. It also implies a concentration of power when some privileged users have the prerogative to manipulate transactions, for example, for unilaterally canceling a transaction or charging fees.
177		Hidden Centrality in Blockchain: The Oligopoly Effect on Distributed Systems
176	0.6854	Hidden centrality. The need to solve a puzzle for each block added to the blockchain data structure, and the rules for distributing rewards that contribute to the integrity of the system, lead to an arms race between actors in terms of their computing power.

Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
177	0.5842	The remaining group of actors forms an oligopoly that divides responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the system among themselves. Much like oligopolies in other industries, this small group of actors could abuse their power. This effect creates a kind of hidden centrality that undermines the distributed nature of the entire system. From a technical point of view, such a system is still a distributed system, but it is a system whose integrity is maintained only by a small number of actors.
170	0.5568	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain.

184	0.5282	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.

50	0.5792	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.

182	0.7408	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system.

227	0.6106	In 2018, the BAMF decided to evaluate the potential of blockchain technology in the context of asylum as part of a proof-of-concept project. A blockchain-based system was designed by a mixed team of science and practice. In addition to the advantages of the blockchain mentioned here, the immutability and transparency of the data in particular pose major challenges with regard to data protection. This is particularly important in the asylum process, in which extremely sensitive data must be stored and processed. The consideration of legal aspects is naturally in the foreground of such a project.
162	0.5908	Public versus private blockchain. Distinguishing between a public blockchain system (without access permissions) and a private (permissoned) blockchain system (with access authorization), where participants have reliable identities and only verified members of the network can participate, is crucial to designing a blockchain application. Private blockchains are better suited for business applications, especially in regulated industries, such as the financial or energy sectors. They are based on customer knowledge and regulatory requirements. The lack of complicated PoW makes private blockchains less energy-intensive.

However, the fact is that blockchain applications are being researched in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all kinds.
34	0.5777	The areas of application are manifold and can certainly not be described conclusively here. Much of the early interest in blockchain technology arose around its application in financial transactions. This is understandable when you consider that the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been used worldwide, proving that blockchain technology can actually work. Banks and other financially relevant institutions have also become early innovators in this area. Other industries, including healthcare, the public sector, agriculture, energy, and many more, are exploring how they can use blockchain to enable the secure exchange of data such as personal health information, digital assets, or real estate data.
181		Challenges of Legal Acceptance in Blockchain Transactions
182	0.7928	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress.

206	0.5266	General design aspects. Blockchain technology was initially taken up by the financial industry. Above all, however, new players were pushing into the market. It was also the intention of Bitcoin to establish an alternative to existing processes in banking. Banks carry out intensive account reconciliations for transfers, which are triggered in batch mode at the end of the day. Therefore, a transfer from one customer to another a few days and longer if it is an international transfer. In addition, absurdly high fees are sometimes charged, especially for international money transfers.

On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
174	0.5516	Solving this puzzle is intentionally time-consuming. Insisting on solving the hash puzzle is one way to make the manipulation of the transaction history unjustifiably complex. Unfortunately, this security measure is accompanied by a reduced processing speed and thus a limited scalability. This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.

159	0.5300	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
19	0.5278	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another.

31	0.5261	Due to the positioning of Bitcoin outside the control of state and financial authorities and its potential for abuse as an instrument of fraud, money laundering and other illegal activities, as well as other concerns such as its volatility and the unregulated nature of the exchanges on which Bitcoin is traded, cryptocurrencies are viewed with particular skepticism and concern. This image often rubs off on blockchain technology in general.
154	0.5152	Robustness against manipulation. The path of the tree-shaped blockchain data structure that represents the greatest computational overhead is the authorized version of the transaction history. Setting up and maintaining the authorized path is just a matter of controlling most of the computing power of the entire system. This fact is the basis for the robustness of the blockchain. As long as honest actors have the most computing resources of the entire system, the path they manage grows the fastest and surpasses all competing paths.
217	0.5126	They can recognize the re-registration of long-standing passive network participants as trusted members. Blockchain can support the growth and development of IoT, including fraud management, identity management, authentication, authorization, billing, and audits. The sheer volume dimension of IoT creates new management problems that existing systems have not yet faced. Automating many, if not all, aspects of operations will be crucial, and blockchain is well positioned to take on critical roles here.
186	0.5124	Security versus speed. Without exaggeration, it can be stated that the history of transaction data is the heart of the blockchain. The history of transaction data is protected from manipulation and falsification by storing it in an immutable blockchain data structure. It also requires the solution of a hash puzzle for each block that is added or rewritten. Not only does this make it extraordinarily costly to manipulate or falsifying the history of transaction data, but it also slows down the speed at which new transaction data can be added to the blockchain data structure.
187		Balancing Security and Scalability: Addressing the Trade-off Between Proof of Work and Transaction Speed in Blockchain.
187	0.6276	This is in contrast to the speed and scalability requirements of many applications in a commercial context. Therefore, the resulting conflict exists between securing the history of transactional data based on time-consuming proof of work on the one hand and the requirements for speed and scalability of users on the other.
173	0.5916	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.

In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
163	0.6026	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
162	0.5883	Public versus private blockchain. Distinguishing between a public blockchain system (without access permissions) and a private (permissoned) blockchain system (with access authorization), where participants have reliable identities and only verified members of the network can participate, is crucial to designing a blockchain application. Private blockchains are better suited for business applications, especially in regulated industries, such as the financial or energy sectors. They are based on customer knowledge and regulatory requirements. The lack of complicated PoW makes private blockchains less energy-intensive.
185	0.5784	However, this approach is contrary to the concept of privacy. Privacy means that transactional data, or details of how the accounts involved or the amount transferred, should remain hidden from the public. The resulting conflict consists, on the one hand, in the transparency required to clarify ownership and, on the other hand, in the higher data protection requirements of users.
189		Ensuring Data Privacy and Compliance: Separating Personal Data in Blockchain Systems
189	0.6443	The exact temporal assignment (time stamp) and the immutability of the transaction data is an important aspect of blockchains. Once stored, data can no longer be changed. This can be a problem if the General Data Protection Regulation gives users the right to be forgotten and all of a user's personal data must be deleted. Any design of a blockchain that is contrary to legal regulations is automatically doomed to failure. In the present case, it makes sense to separate the personal data from the actual transaction data via a link.
215	0.6420	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
183	0.6104	Lack of user acceptance. Blockchain faces two conflicts: Transparency vs. data protection and Security vs. Speed
184	0.5936	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
42	0.5927	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
46	0.5892	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
227	0.5767	In 2018, the BAMF decided to evaluate the potential of blockchain technology in the context of asylum as part of a proof-of-concept project. A blockchain-based system was designed by a mixed team of science and practice. In addition to the advantages of the blockchain mentioned here, the immutability and transparency of the data in particular pose major challenges with regard to data protection. This is particularly important in the asylum process, in which extremely sensitive data must be stored and processed. The consideration of legal aspects is naturally in the foreground of such a project.
170	0.5575	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.
2	0.5542	This course explains blockchain beyond this garish and sensational image. Blockchain is above all a technology for distributed, flexible and individualized data management. Essentially, the data refers to participants, documents and transactions that change the status and characteristics of the participants or the things described in the documents.
228	0.5510	The advantage of a blockchain solution lies in the creation of a uniform information on the status of asylum procedures that crosses the organization. This level of information is visible, comprehensible and cannot be manipulated by all authorities involved and forms the basis for improving process integrity. Smart contracts can also support the management of these processes and enable the establishment of an inter-agency process management system in the future. In addition, a blockchain solution can support decentralized data storage and thus contribute in particular to the data sovereignty of the individual authorities.
190		Balancing Security and Speed: Exploring Different Approaches to Write Access in Blockchain Systems
43	0.6390	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
190	0.6352	Decision about security vs. speed. When you make a decision about the security or speed conflict, you must decide who you want to grant write access to. If only extreme cases where write access is granted are considered, there are two options: grant write access to everyone, but make it computationally intensive by requiring the PoW, or restrict write access to a select group of actors that have been trusted. We can distinguish between the following types of blockchains by granting write access:
129	0.6062	In blockchain technology, this is achieved through three principles: Storage of a transaction history in such a way that even the smallest changes to the history are noticed and noticed. Even inserting the smallest detail forces much of the transaction history to be rewritten. Adding, writing, or rewriting data to the transaction history is extremely computationally intensive.
183	0.6006	Lack of user acceptance. Blockchain faces two conflicts: Transparency vs. data protection and Security vs. Speed
173	0.5707	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
61	0.5685	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
42	0.5583	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
174	0.5520	Solving this puzzle is intentionally time-consuming. Insisting on solving the hash puzzle is one way to make the manipulation of the transaction history unjustifiably complex. Unfortunately, this security measure is accompanied by a reduced processing speed and thus a limited scalability. This property of blockchain is seen as a serious hurdle for use in application areas that require high processing speed, high scalability and high data throughput.
22	0.5486	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
59	0.5469	Double spending is one of the most important examples of integrity breaches in distributed peer-to-peer systems. After transferring ownership from one person to another, all ledgers of the system must be updated so that the latest version reflects the new reality.  However, sharing information between members in the blockchain system and updating individual ledgers will take time. Some members already know about the last transfer of ownership, while others have not yet received this information. At this point, the system is not consistent.  
191		Write Access in Blockchain Systems: Exploring Permissionless and Authorized Approaches
191	0.7363	Permissionless: blockchains grant write access to everyone. Any user or node can verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain data structure. Authorized blockchains grant write access only to a limited group of selected actors: identified as trusted by a registration process. As a result, only the group of actors who have write access can verify transactions and participate in the distributed consensus process.
163	0.6433	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion.

An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
164	0.6180	A legitimate blockchain relies on the identity of its actors and can therefore use the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus. Permissionless or public blockchains offer a platform for new business models. However, by definition, they are based on a very computationally intensive computational model to ensure transaction integrity.
43	0.5993	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
32	0.5967	Blockchain platforms can be designed either as a public blockchain (without access authorization, permissionless) or private blockchain (with explicit access authorization, permissioned). In a public, permissionless blockchain like Bitcoin, any node on the network (without prior authentication) can transact and participate in the consensus process. In a private blockchain with access authorization, any node can execute transactions, but participation in the consensus process is limited to a limited number of verified nodes.
166	0.5636	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
111	0.5544	By signing and verifying transactions, the transfer of ownership in blockchain is authorized.
181	0.5477	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
162	0.5449	Public versus private blockchain. Distinguishing between a public blockchain system (without access permissions) and a private (permissoned) blockchain system (with access authorization), where participants have reliable identities and only verified members of the network can participate, is crucial to designing a blockchain application. Private blockchains are better suited for business applications, especially in regulated industries, such as the financial or energy sectors.

192		Challenges in the Supply Chain: Trust and Accountability
192	0.5475	Trust in the supply chain. Alice owns a fish restaurant. She has some trouble because recent shipments of frozen fish have been spoiled. Bob, her supplier, denies responsibility and charges Carl, the fisherman.
51	0.4457	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
128	0.4337	The protocol of the accounting takes into account that some actors are honest and follow the protocol, while others are dishonest and deviate from the protocol, as in real life, when many people participate in a common cause. A blockchain is open to any actor. But even if it weren't open to every actor, we can't assume that we can trust everyone in the user community. The protective mechanism that offers itself here is to make any kind of manipulation immensely complex.
215	0.4196	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain.

Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
177	0.4190	The remaining group of actors forms an oligopoly that divides responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the system among themselves. Much like oligopolies in other industries, this small group of actors could abuse their power. This effect creates a kind of hidden centrality that undermines the distributed nature of the entire system. From a technical point of view, such a system is still a distributed system, but it is a system whose integrity is maintained only by a small number of actors.
229	0.4187	Systems for tracking products in the recyclable materials chain Companies can use IoT sensors and blockchain to show that they meet compliance requirements or customs regulations through the traceability of their products. One of the challenges in compliance is transparency in traceability. Blockchain makes it easier to implement traceability. For example, there is a world health organization guide on good distribution practices for the distribution of pharmaceutical products.
231	0.4185	Companies can use a blockchain for tracking systems to ensure compliance. Blockchain provides a system for capturing supply chain data that can be shared both securely and transparently with all actors involved in the supply chain, reducing administrative costs and processing times. In this way, customs could verify the shipping data of an entire supply chain. Any efforts to manipulate the broadcast would be verifiable. Items in supply chains already have barcodes, so capturing items after they've been placed on a global blockchain for IoT tracking isn't a huge leap.
42	0.4112	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context.

49	0.4056	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
50	0.3975	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.

159	0.5825	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus.

52	0.5644	The problem of achieving and maintaining integrity and trust in a system consisting of an unknown number of members with unknown trustworthiness is well known and widely used in computer science. It is called the problem of Byzantine generals.
126	0.5517	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
65	0.5413	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.

197	0.5471	At every stage, Alice’s supply-chain blockchain includes identities and access control. The temperature sensors sign their votes, so voter fraud is impossible. Only Alice, Bob, Carl, and the sensors have permission to write to the record list, so it is possible to hold participants accountable if someone tries to tamper with the ledger. In this distributed data storage, a linked list serves as a ledger and a combination of fault-tolerant Byzantine votes and human signatures serves as a consensus. The principle of ledger plus consensus is essential in blockchains.
44	0.5413	Each peer keeps a copy of the ledger. The peers run a consensus log to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and create a hash chain over the blocks. This process is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.

195	0.4772	Each time a frozen fish box is transferred from Carl’s fisher boat to Bob’s truck, Bob and Carl sign a statement agreeing the change of custody. The same happens when Bob delivers the fish to Alice. At each such transfer, the signed change-of-custody certificate is time stamped, the prior record is hashed, and the current record is appended to the list.
62	0.4737	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
182	0.4441	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system.

64	0.4387	Design of ledgers for distributed and untrusted environments. The best way to prevent the transaction history from being changed is to make it immutable. This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.
56	0.4327	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.

Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
229	0.5751	Systems for tracking products in the recyclable materials chain Companies can use IoT sensors and blockchain to show that they meet compliance requirements or customs regulations through the traceability of their products. One of the challenges in compliance is transparency in traceability. Blockchain makes it easier to implement traceability. For example, there is a world health organization guide on good distribution practices for the distribution of pharmaceutical products.
184	0.5672	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
166	0.5522	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
232	0.5482	Exporters can upload documents to a customs blockchain to show that they comply with national import regulations, such as hygiene or phytosanitary regulations. Blockchain provides secure tracking of the exact locations of goods and accurate shipment content information to determine precise customs tariffs. Blockchain for tracing in the value chain could also help reduce the control effort at customs. However, there are still no successful implementations.
233	0.5432	Paper-based systems tend to be less suitable for tracking. The blockchain's immutable, robust records, secure mapping at the time of creation, and the use of smart contracts can make monitoring customs border trade more efficient and transparent. Information about goods such as customs declarations, proof of origin and purchase or loading lists can become part of an accessible block for suppliers, transporters, buyers, regulators and auditors. Increased transparency of the use of blockchain in traceability leads to lower transaction, audit and accounting costs.
19	0.5362	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
62	0.5321	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
170	0.5313	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.
181	0.5275	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.

217	0.6007	They can recognize the re-registration of long-standing passive network participants as trusted members. Blockchain can support the growth and development of IoT, including fraud management, identity management, authentication, authorization, billing, and audits. The sheer volume dimension of IoT creates new management problems that existing systems have not yet faced. Automating many, if not all, aspects of operations will be crucial, and blockchain is well positioned to take on critical roles here.
215	0.5925	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
126	0.5892	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.

43	0.5624	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
56	0.5612	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.
94	0.5585	The blockchain must uniquely identify participants and assets and ensure that only the rightful owner can access their property. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system that is open to all. Anyone can connect and provision computing resources or send new transaction data to the system. However, it is not desirable for everyone to access the asset that is assigned to the account managed by the blockchain. An essential feature of private property is its exclusivity. The right to transfer ownership to another account is limited to the owner of the account who hands over ownership.

198		Achieving Customer Retention and Capital Generation through Digital Coupon Crowdfunding
198	0.7259	Customer retention through coupons. Alice wants to expand her business and to open a new restaurant. She decides to raise her own capital by crowdfunding. She sells digital coupons redeemable for discount meals when the new restaurant opens. Alice hopes that her coupon system will go viral, and soon people from all over the world will be clamoring to buy Alice’s coupons (many with the intention of reselling them at a markup).
201	0.4156	Next, Alice must decide how to manage her blockchain. As she does not want to do it herself, she will crowdsource blockchain management by offering additional coupons as a fee to anyone who volunteers to be a miner, that is, to do the work of running a consensus protocol. She sets up a peer-to-peer network (also called gossip network) to allow coupon aficionados to share data.
199	0.3867	Alice decides her coupons will be more attractive if she keeps them on a blockchain as cryptocoupons. Then Alice’s coupons have three components: a private key, a public key, and a ledger entry. Knowledge of the private key confers ownership: anyone who knows that private key can transfer ownership of (“spend”) the coupon. The public key enables proof of ownership: anyone can verify that a message encrypted with the private key came from the coupon’s owner. The ledger conveys value: it establishes the link between the public key and the coupon with an entry saying: “Anyone who knows the secret key matching the following public key owns one cryptocoupon”.
200	0.3758	Suppose Bob owns a coupon, and decides to transfer half of it Carl, and keep the other half for himself. Bob and Carl each generate a pair of private and public keys. Bob creates a new ledger entry with his current public key, his new public key, and Carl’s public key, saying “I, the owner of the private key matching the first public key, do hereby transfer ownership of the corresponding coupon of the owners of the private keys matching the next two public keys.” Spending one of Alice’s cryptocoupons is like breaking a 20€ bill into two 10€ bills: the old coupon is consumed and replaced by two distinct coupons of smaller value.
209	0.3121	Smart contracts can enable microtransactions for different types of billing. For example, they could be used in a digital wallet to control expenses: you can give your son €20 in the digital wallet with the condition that the money cannot be spent on fast food and on cinema tickets only if the screening does not take place in the afternoon, when he should actually do his homework.
210	0.3042	Further application sketches can result from the following parameters: People in Third World countries that do not have an established banking system can participate in the economy with the help of Bitcoin. Protection of copyrights. Development of a sharing economy based on sharing and exchanging goods and services. Improvement of international transfers, which can be made faster and cheaper. Reduce the cost of executing and verifying transactions.
207	0.2991	With a blockchain in which all financial actors are involved, a money transfer can be executed in seconds, at almost disappearing transaction costs. However, there are other sectors that are also using blockchain in the meantime, such as healthcare, energy, human resources, real estate trading, education and others. A variety of industries could benefit from the use of smart contracts that control supply chains and record the corresponding transactions on a blockchain.
240	0.2900	While most experts agree that blockchain will eventually be used by human resources for hiring and administrative purposes, the use of blockchains is not yet in sight here. In contrast to financial applications, recruitment, CVs or job histories do not yet have use cases that credibly demonstrate trustworthy use in the management of histories. This means that the use of blockchain technology will initially be limited to the review and documentation of education and training.
60	0.2812	Only one of them should be the new and rightful owner. Therefore, the situation is called the problem of double spending. In the context of copying digital goods, the problem of double spending refers to the fact that data can be copied on a computer without significant restrictions. Copying a representation of a unique real object (house, money, cars, etc.) is the digital equivalent of counterfeiting banknotes with a photocopier.
205	0.2790	In the blockchain world, costly signaling is usually called proof of work (PoW). In PoW, consensus is reached by holding a self-administered lottery among the miners to decide which transaction is appended next to the ledger. Here is the clever part: buying a lottery ticket is a form of costly signaling because, well, it is costly: expensive in terms of time wasted and electricity bills. Kate’s talent for impersonation is useless to her if each of her fake miners must buy an expensive, long shot lottery ticket.

This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
199	0.5393	Alice decides her coupons will be more attractive if she keeps them on a blockchain as cryptocoupons. Then Alice’s coupons have three components: a private key, a public key, and a ledger entry. Knowledge of the private key confers ownership: anyone who knows that private key can transfer ownership of (“spend”) the coupon. The public key enables proof of ownership: anyone can verify that a message encrypted with the private key came from the coupon’s owner. The ledger conveys value: it establishes the link between the public key and the coupon with an entry saying: “Anyone who knows the secret key matching the following public key owns one cryptocoupon”.
163	0.5389	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
126	0.5302	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
65	0.5288	Add a new transaction to the ledgers. All members of the peer-to-peer system can add new data, while at the same time each member of the peer-to-peer system acts as the supervisor of all members. Decide which ledger represent the truth. Avoiding conflicts between transaction histories is a serious threat to the integrity of the system. The blockchain must decide which transaction history is the truth. It solves the problem by having each node in the peer-to-peer system decide which transaction history is the true one, and the majority of members independently agree to that decision.
46	0.5286	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
31	0.5163	Due to the positioning of Bitcoin outside the control of state and financial authorities and its potential for abuse as an instrument of fraud, money laundering and other illegal activities, as well as other concerns such as its volatility and the unregulated nature of the exchanges on which Bitcoin is traded, cryptocurrencies are viewed with particular skepticism and concern. This image often rubs off on blockchain technology in general.

166	0.5344	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.

An actor has to do elaborate and provable work so that he can propose one or more transactions. Basically, in a blockchain community, the same problem arises as when organizing a street gang: how to ensure that someone who wants to join the gang is not a plainclothes police officer, detective, or just a free rider?

It was also the intention of Bitcoin to establish an alternative to existing processes in banking. Banks carry out intensive account reconciliations for transfers, which are triggered in batch mode at the end of the day. Therefore, a transfer from one customer to another a few days and longer if it is an international transfer. In addition, absurdly high fees are sometimes charged, especially for international money transfers.

216	0.5738	Application examples and sketches. Blockchain and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Blockchain, the technology that made Bitcoin possible, has received a lot of attention in the IoT world, often because of its role in privacy and security. The potential of blockchain for IoT is greater than just keeping evil actors in the network at bay. Smart contracts in blockchains, for example, can take over the activation of authentication of devices, especially if they are rarely connected, as could be the case, with systems in agriculture that are shut down for large parts of the year.

209		Smart Contracts for Controlled Microtransactions and Expense Management
209	0.5963	Smart contracts can enable microtransactions for different types of billing. For example, they could be used in a digital wallet to control expenses: you can give your son €20 in the digital wallet with the condition that the money cannot be spent on fast food and on cinema tickets only if the screening does not take place in the afternoon, when he should actually do his homework.
207	0.5007	With a blockchain in which all financial actors are involved, a money transfer can be executed in seconds, at almost disappearing transaction costs.

A variety of industries could benefit from the use of smart contracts that control supply chains and record the corresponding transactions on a blockchain.
160	0.5000	A smart contract is a computer protocol that determines interactions between actors in any type of blockchain. It sets out the rules and conditions under which a transaction or exchange is considered valid.
208	0.4753	Automating healthcare payment processes using smart contracts can prevent incorrect payments and fraud. The music industry could include the intellectual property of music or videos on the blockchain and then define a smart contract to ensure that royalties are paid when the music is used for commercial purposes. Smart contracts and blockchain could benefit the automotive industry by storing easily accessible information about vehicle maintenance and accident and ownership history.
218	0.4603	Many IoT use cases include, for example, the fast communication setup between several business partners. This communication must implement legal and financial actions, regulated in service level agreements (SLAs). By using smart contracts over the blockchain, defined by trusted actors, participants in a system can be sure that objective information is provided and SLAs are continuously monitored. Other use cases for blockchain in the IoT would concern device identity. Is a particular device authorized to act as an actor in the network or has it been noticed in the past by negative behavior.
64	0.4454	Design of ledgers for distributed and untrusted environments. The best way to prevent the transaction history from being changed is to make it immutable. This means that the ledger and thus the transaction history can no longer be changed after writing. At the same time, however, it must be able to add new transactions. Distributing the ledgers. Interaction between the members (or nodes) and control of the information is shared between all members.
72	0.4388	Limit the number of transactions per user. Limit the total quantity of items/assets that can be sold in a given period. Enforce that an account retains an item/asset for a minimum period of time before it can be further transferred. Authorization. Only the owner of the account who hands over ownership should be allowed to instruct the blockchain to execute a transaction on their behalf.
157	0.4354	The smart contract is the essential core of a blockchain. It determines which actors are involved in which transactions and how, and regulates how the transfer of property, information, etc. takes place. This chapter explains some design parameters that should be considered when developing blockchain applications (public versus private blockchain, transparency versus privacy, and a few more). A small case study explains the design of a blockchain application. Application examples and design sketches show how this still young technology is currently being implemented in practice and which application perspectives already exist.
35	0.4350	Manufacturing companies and other similar companies also see some potential to use blockchain to manage smart contracts and track materials as they move through their supply chains. Experts believe that blockchain can be used in tax collection, asset transfers, distribution of social benefits, and even voting procedures such as elections. Blockchain can also be used to exchange legal and similar documents such as certificates, testimonials and proofs.
161	0.4138	From a legal point of view, a smart contract is not necessarily a contract consisting of two corresponding declarations of intent (offer and acceptance of the offer). A smart contract, on the other hand, is merely a software-based protocol that entails other agreed protocol steps when a previously defined condition occurs. Actually, a smart contract is a process for documenting a contract. One of the essential characteristics of smart contracts is the unstoppability of once programmed processes after conditions have occurred.
210		Blockchain for Diverse Applications: Economic Inclusion, Copyright Protection, Sharing Economy, and Efficient Transfers
181	0.6293	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
36	0.6157	Some believe that individuals can use this technology to have better control over personal information and then selectively share parts of their data when necessary; Use cases here include individual medical records and corporate supply chains.

It firmly manifests the feasibility of peer-to-peer communication over the Internet without the need for a trusted intermediary.
184	0.6137	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
35	0.6099	Manufacturing companies and other similar companies also see some potential to use blockchain to manage smart contracts and track materials as they move through their supply chains. Experts believe that blockchain can be used in tax collection, asset transfers, distribution of social benefits, and even voting procedures such as elections.

A variety of industries could benefit from the use of smart contracts that control supply chains and record the corresponding transactions on a blockchain.
62	0.5893	Blockchain is software that manages ownership and possession in a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers, which in turn operates in an open and untrustworthy environment. Blockchain must therefore cope with seven main tasks: Capturing the Transfer of Ownership: Transactions are a good way to describe property transfers. The complete history of transactions is the key to identifying the current owners.
183	0.5849	Lack of user acceptance. Blockchain faces two conflicts: Transparency vs. data protection and Security vs. Speed
210	0.5777	Further application sketches can result from the following parameters: People in Third World countries that do not have an established banking system can participate in the economy with the help of Bitcoin. Protection of copyrights. Development of a sharing economy based on sharing and exchanging goods and services. Improvement of international transfers, which can be made faster and cheaper. Reduce the cost of executing and verifying transactions.
163	0.5775	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
211		Steps in Designing a Blockchain Application: From Use Case Mapping to Production Rollout
211	0.7845	Basically, the following steps should be considered when designing a blockchain application: Description of the essential use cases and their mapping in a technology development plan. Presentation of a proof of concept. Performing tests initially with limited functionality, but which offer a certain user experience. Later, more data and more interaction are underpinned. Complete rollout of the production system.
37	0.5741	For a company, blockchain offers the following basic possibilities: A design approach that keeps transaction data, value, and status inherently close to business logic. The necessary data schemas for transactional data are easier to manage. Secure execution of business transactions validated by the community of all network users, in a secure process that enables the trust and robust transaction processing that are fundamental to blockchain.
157	0.5694	The smart contract is the essential core of a blockchain. It determines which actors are involved in which transactions and how, and regulates how the transfer of property, information, etc. takes place. This chapter explains some design parameters that should be considered when developing blockchain applications (public versus private blockchain, transparency versus privacy, and a few more). A small case study explains the design of a blockchain application. Application examples and design sketches show how this still young technology is currently being implemented in practice and which application perspectives already exist.
34	0.5417	The areas of application are manifold and can certainly not be described conclusively here. Much of the early interest in blockchain technology arose around its application in financial transactions. This is understandable when you consider that the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been used worldwide, proving that blockchain technology can actually work. Banks and other financially relevant institutions have also become early innovators in this area. Other industries, including healthcare, the public sector, agriculture, energy, and many more, are exploring how they can use blockchain to enable the secure exchange of data such as personal health information, digital assets, or real estate data.
42	0.5375	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
227	0.4996	In 2018, the BAMF decided to evaluate the potential of blockchain technology in the context of asylum as part of a proof-of-concept project. A blockchain-based system was designed by a mixed team of science and practice. In addition to the advantages of the blockchain mentioned here, the immutability and transparency of the data in particular pose major challenges with regard to data protection. This is particularly important in the asylum process, in which extremely sensitive data must be stored and processed. The consideration of legal aspects is naturally in the foreground of such a project.
35	0.4966	Manufacturing companies and other similar companies also see some potential to use blockchain to manage smart contracts and track materials as they move through their supply chains. Experts believe that blockchain can be used in tax collection, asset transfers, distribution of social benefits, and even voting procedures such as elections. Blockchain can also be used to exchange legal and similar documents such as certificates, testimonials and proofs.
215	0.4960	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
40	0.4955	Articles in the press have questioned whether blockchain technologies, as they exist now, are sufficiently reliable to deploy on a large scale. Topics include the lack of regulations for this new form of exchange and safety concerns. Blockchains are usually associated with digital currencies such as Bitcoin or alternative versions. However, the fact is that blockchain applications are being researched in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all kinds.
182	0.4938	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system. Those who have witnessed the emergence and development of the Internet may see a similarity between the legal status of today's blockchain and the lack of legal acceptance of e-commerce in the nineties.
212		Challenges of Mining in Blockchain Design: Environmental Impact and Centralization Concerns
212	0.5720	When designing a blockchain application, one should consider the disadvantages already mentioned: Mining is ecologically difficult to justify. This process requires a lot of computing power and in the meantime also special hardware. Only those who have this hardware and corresponding computing power can solve hash puzzles quickly enough to suggest transactions for booking and achieve the associated remuneration. This counteracts the democratic nature of the blockchain, according to which all actors should benefit from the mining process as equally as possible if only large mining pools are successful here.
178	0.5427	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.
1	0.5365	There are many misleading stories about blockchain. Much of the stories are about cryptocurrencies that led to incredible wealth or nightmare losses, or form the basis for a new financial system that supports dark markets for weapons or drugs. Blockchain is also considered a technology with enormous energy requirements. The variety of design and application possibilities of this technology and the opportunities thvat result from it are omitted from these stories.
169	0.5298	Technical limitations of the blockchain. The main technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of privacy; The Security Model; Limited scalability; High costs; Hidden centrality; Lack of flexibility; Critical size
180	0.5282	Non-technical limitations of the blockchain. The main non-technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of legal recognition. Lack of user acceptance
19	0.5177	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
39	0.5132	Experts cite several important benefits for using blockchain. Security is considered one of the main advantages of this technology. It is almost impossible to manipulate a blockchain because information from thousands, even millions of computers, is shared and constantly compared with each other. In addition, blockchain does not have a singular point of failure. If one node fails, this is not a problem because all other nodes have a copy of the ledger. Whether blockchain will revolutionize the way public administration, institutions and industries work is an open question.
34	0.5087	The areas of application are manifold and can certainly not be described conclusively here. Much of the early interest in blockchain technology arose around its application in financial transactions.

181	0.5087	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.
42	0.5020	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
213		The Trilemma of Consensus: Balancing Security, Scalability, and Decentralization in Blockchain Design
213	0.6265	The consensus algorithm contains the so-called trilemma: security, scalability and decentralization. In order to increase scalability and also the processing speed in a blockchain, security must be reduced (transition from PoW to PoS, for example) or decentralization (PoA). Processing speed is a serious problem with blockchains. Bitcoin, for example, creates a throughput of seven transactions per second. Visa's system comes to about 1700 transactions per second with central data storage. This means that blockchains are only accepted if there are no significant differences in performance to central systems.
19	0.6232	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
3	0.5727	Strictly speaking, blockchain and distributed technology is less a technology itself, but rather a technology group that can be characterized, at least from an algorithmic point of view, via a protocol of chaining, distribution, and consensus. The basic principles have been known for a long time and have also been used in the context of public data security.
159	0.5677	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
166	0.5626	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
126	0.5621	Blockchain creates consensus and trust between actors who may not know each other at all. In a blockchain application, actors exchange assets such as money, property, services or certificates without a central authority on the authenticity of the exchange actions. This greatly speeds up the processing of the corresponding transactions and paves the way for a completely new generation of transactional applications, especially if consensus can be reached automatically. Instead of a central authority, all actors in the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain application confirm the authenticity of the exchange actions. This joint confirmation is called consensus.
22	0.5621	Now, the technology of the 21st century has taken the next step with cryptography, advanced algorithms, stronger and almost universally available computing power to make the distributed attitude of ledgers a more viable form of recording. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have neither a central data store nor centralized management functions. In a distributed ledger (or ledger), each node processes and verifies each entry, generating a record for each entry, and seeking consensus on the accuracy of that entry.
61	0.5551	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
50	0.5537	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.
173	0.5462	Limited scalability. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer system designed to achieve two goals: First, all users can add new transaction data to the collectively managed history. On the other hand, it ensures that the history of the transaction data is protected against manipulation or falsification. The blockchain balances both goals by using an immutable data structure that contains only attachments and that requires the solution of a hash puzzle every time a new block is added.
214		Trade-offs in Consensus Mechanisms: Exploring Speed, Security, and Centralization in Blockchain Design
213	0.6221	The consensus algorithm contains the so-called trilemma: security, scalability and decentralization.

43	0.5498	Among the many disadvantages of Bitcoin (comparatively slow confirmation times, regular attacks, high energy consumption, etc.), the lack of control over updates and changes to the network and the difficulty of adapting the existing Bitcoin technology to individual needs. For this reason, many organizations prefer to create their own, private blockchain systems with access control. On a technical level, a blockchain can be defined as an immutable ledger or ledger for recording transactions managed in a distributed network of untrusted partners.
183	0.5396	Lack of user acceptance. Blockchain faces two conflicts: Transparency vs. data protection and Security vs. Speed
33	0.5377	Choosing the consensus algorithm to use is perhaps the most important aspect when choosing a blockchain platform. There are five standard methods to reach consensus. In general, public platforms choose algorithms such as Proof of Work because they require a lot of computing power for computation and are easy to verify for the network nodes involved. Proof-of-Work (PoW). Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm (PBFT). Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Proof-of-Authority (PoA). Proof-of-Honesty (PoH)

The basic principles have been known for a long time and have also been used in the context of public data security.
176	0.5300	Hidden centrality. The need to solve a puzzle for each block added to the blockchain data structure, and the rules for distributing rewards that contribute to the integrity of the system, lead to an arms race between actors in terms of their computing power. The supposedly large and democratic group of actors who together maintain the integrity of the system eventually become a very small group of actors who have enormous computing power, often in the form of specialized hardware.
178	0.5294	Lack of flexibility. The blockchain is a complex technical construct that consists of a variety of concepts and protocols that are optimized and coordinated with each other. Changing the finely tuned ecosystem can be a major challenge.

228	0.5325	The advantage of a blockchain solution lies in the creation of a uniform information on the status of asylum procedures that crosses the organization. This level of information is visible, comprehensible and cannot be manipulated by all authorities involved and forms the basis for improving process integrity. Smart contracts can also support the management of these processes and enable the establishment of an inter-agency process management system in the future. In addition, a blockchain solution can support decentralized data storage and thus contribute in particular to the data sovereignty of the individual authorities.

49	0.4958	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.

Blockchain, the technology that made Bitcoin possible, has received a lot of attention in the IoT world, often because of its role in privacy and security. The potential of blockchain for IoT is greater than just keeping evil actors in the network at bay. Smart contracts in blockchains, for example, can take over the activation of authentication of devices, especially if they are rarely connected, as could be the case, with systems in agriculture that are shut down for large parts of the year.
218	0.5340	Many IoT use cases include, for example, the fast communication setup between several business partners. This communication must implement legal and financial actions, regulated in service level agreements (SLAs). By using smart contracts over the blockchain, defined by trusted actors, participants in a system can be sure that objective information is provided and SLAs are continuously monitored. Other use cases for blockchain in the IoT would concern device identity. Is a particular device authorized to act as an actor in the network or has it been noticed in the past by negative behavior.
46	0.4829	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
163	0.4780	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity.

This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
215	0.5139	Data security and integrity can be ensured in a variety of ways. Blockchain achieves this through distributed trust among stakeholders. However, if the planned system does not require distributed trust, there is no need to strive for a public blockchain. An open question with blockchain is its integration into the current system landscapes of companies. Thus, the handling of transaction data must not only meet certain legal framework conditions. Blockchains must also be able to deliver data to other applications or user interfaces in the company (keyword: interoperability).
166	0.5119	For private blockchains, a number of consensus mechanisms have been developed as an alternative to energy-intensive proof-of-work: Proof-of-Authority (PoA): is a consensus mechanism that works more efficiently and maintains BFT. The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
216	0.4974	Application examples and sketches. Blockchain and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Blockchain, the technology that made Bitcoin possible, has received a lot of attention in the IoT world, often because of its role in privacy and security. The potential of blockchain for IoT is greater than just keeping evil actors in the network at bay. Smart contracts in blockchains, for example, can take over the activation of authentication of devices, especially if they are rarely connected, as could be the case, with systems in agriculture that are shut down for large parts of the year.
159	0.4822	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
163	0.4785	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
219		Ensuring Authenticity and Integrity: Secure Storage of Images and Videos on the Blockchain
219	0.7369	Secure storage of images and videos. In a blockchain, images and videos can be stored with time stamps. If they can only be retrieved from there, it would be immediately recognizable if they were later manipulated. The digital fingerprint can be used at any time for unambiguous authentication.
49	0.5771	Maintaining integrity and trust in distributed systems is the main purpose of blockchain. In the context of software systems, integrity is the property of a system to be secure, complete, consistent, correct, and free from manipulation and error.  Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, correctness, or ability of someone or something without having to provide evidence. People will remain loyal toa system if they trust it and if the results of day-to-day interactions with the system confirm and strengthen their trust. Integrity is required to meet users' expectations and strengthen their trust in the system.
56	0.5745	Integrity and trust are one challenge that the blockchain has to face, the other is the management of property. Proof of ownership includes three elements: Identification of the owner. Identification of the object of which it is the owner. Assignment of the owner to the object. In real life, we use passports, testimonials, birth certificates, serial numbers, and even testimonies to obtain these three elements as evidence. Usually this takes some time.

42	0.5559	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.

This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
51	0.5305	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
61	0.5169	The problem of double spending is an important example of the violation of integrity in distributed peer-to-peer systems of ledgers that   blockchain technology has to solve.
50	0.5147	Achieving and maintaining integrity in purely distributed systems such as blockchains depends on many factors. The two most important are: Knowledge of the number of peers. Knowledge of the trustworthiness of peers. The chances of integrity in a distributed peer-to-peer system are higher if the number of members and their trustworthiness are known (similar to a private club). In a purely distributed peer-to-peer system on the Internet, accessible to everyone, the number of peers and their trustworthiness is inherently unknown.
184	0.5099	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.

A variety of industries could benefit from the use of smart contracts that control supply chains and record the corresponding transactions on a blockchain.
182	0.4730	Questions about the legal implications and acceptance of transactions on the blockchain need to be discussed regardless of security and technical progress. It is the incorporation of a new approach to property management into the established legal system. Those who have witnessed the emergence and development of the Internet may see a similarity between the legal status of today's blockchain and the lack of legal acceptance of e-commerce in the nineties.
40	0.4711	Articles in the press have questioned whether blockchain technologies, as they exist now, are sufficiently reliable to deploy on a large scale. Topics include the lack of regulations for this new form of exchange and safety concerns. Blockchains are usually associated with digital currencies such as Bitcoin or alternative versions. However, the fact is that blockchain applications are being researched in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all kinds.

Distinguishing between a public blockchain system (without access permissions) and a private (permissoned) blockchain system (with access authorization), where participants have reliable identities and only verified members of the network can participate, is crucial to designing a blockchain application. Private blockchains are better suited for business applications, especially in regulated industries, such as the financial or energy sectors. They are based on customer knowledge and regulatory requirements. The lack of complicated PoW makes private blockchains less energy-intensive.

226		Enhancing Efficiency and Transparency in the Asylum and Migration Process through Blockchain Technology
226	0.7843	Blockchain in the context of asylum and migration. Blockchain technology enables digital progress while preserving decentralized, organizational structures such as those that exist in the German federal system. In Germany, for example, the asylum process is carried out by the Central Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) and other authorities at federal, state and local level. There are several variants in the asylum procedure. The seamless exchange of information is made more difficult by fragmented systems and data storage.
227	0.6971	In 2018, the BAMF decided to evaluate the potential of blockchain technology in the context of asylum as part of a proof-of-concept project. A blockchain-based system was designed by a mixed team of science and practice. In addition to the advantages of the blockchain mentioned here, the immutability and transparency of the data in particular pose major challenges with regard to data protection. This is particularly important in the asylum process, in which extremely sensitive data must be stored and processed. The consideration of legal aspects is naturally in the foreground of such a project.
228	0.6328	The advantage of a blockchain solution lies in the creation of a uniform information on the status of asylum procedures that crosses the organization. This level of information is visible, comprehensible and cannot be manipulated by all authorities involved and forms the basis for improving process integrity. Smart contracts can also support the management of these processes and enable the establishment of an inter-agency process management system in the future. In addition, a blockchain solution can support decentralized data storage and thus contribute in particular to the data sovereignty of the individual authorities.
183	0.5294	Lack of user acceptance. Blockchain faces two conflicts: Transparency vs. data protection and Security vs. Speed
34	0.5073	The areas of application are manifold and can certainly not be described conclusively here. Much of the early interest in blockchain technology arose around its application in financial transactions. This is understandable when you consider that the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been used worldwide, proving that blockchain technology can actually work. Banks and other financially relevant institutions have also become early innovators in this area. Other industries, including healthcare, the public sector, agriculture, energy, and many more, are exploring how they can use blockchain to enable the secure exchange of data such as personal health information, digital assets, or real estate data.
206	0.4960	General design aspects. Blockchain technology was initially taken up by the financial industry. Above all, however, new players were pushing into the market. It was also the intention of Bitcoin to establish an alternative to existing processes in banking. Banks carry out intensive account reconciliations for transfers, which are triggered in batch mode at the end of the day. Therefore, a transfer from one customer to another a few days and longer if it is an international transfer. In addition, absurdly high fees are sometimes charged, especially for international money transfers.
181	0.4937	Lack of legal acceptance. Blockchain is a technology that offers its actors the ability to manage and transfer property rights in an open and purely distributed peer-to-peer system. The way independent actors collectively manage property through a distributed consensus has raised questions about the legal consequences of transactions made and managed on the blockchain.

Much of the stories are about cryptocurrencies that led to incredible wealth or nightmare losses, or form the basis for a new financial system that supports dark markets for weapons or drugs. Blockchain is also considered a technology with enormous energy requirements. The variety of design and application possibilities of this technology and the opportunities thvat result from it are omitted from these stories.
19	0.4815	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
170	0.4762	Lack of privacy. The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that keeps the entire history of transaction data open to anyone who has access to the blockchain. All transaction details such as actor, assets or money that was transferred to what extent and when is visible to all. This is necessary so that each actor can identify an owner beyond doubt and verify new transactions. The lack of privacy is therefore an essential element of the blockchain. Without this level of transparency, the blockchain could not fulfill its duty.

157	0.5562	The smart contract is the essential core of a blockchain. It determines which actors are involved in which transactions and how, and regulates how the transfer of property, information, etc. takes place. This chapter explains some design parameters that should be considered when developing blockchain applications (public versus private blockchain, transparency versus privacy, and a few more). A small case study explains the design of a blockchain application. Application examples and design sketches show how this still young technology is currently being implemented in practice and which application perspectives already exist.

Automating many, if not all, aspects of operations will be crucial, and blockchain is well positioned to take on critical roles here.
216	0.5429	Application examples and sketches. Blockchain and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Blockchain, the technology that made Bitcoin possible, has received a lot of attention in the IoT world, often because of its role in privacy and security. The potential of blockchain for IoT is greater than just keeping evil actors in the network at bay. Smart contracts in blockchains, for example, can take over the activation of authentication of devices, especially if they are rarely connected, as could be the case, with systems in agriculture that are shut down for large parts of the year.
231	0.5151	Companies can use a blockchain for tracking systems to ensure compliance. Blockchain provides a system for capturing supply chain data that can be shared both securely and transparently with all actors involved in the supply chain, reducing administrative costs and processing times. In this way, customs could verify the shipping data of an entire supply chain. Any efforts to manipulate the broadcast would be verifiable. Items in supply chains already have barcodes, so capturing items after they've been placed on a global blockchain for IoT tracking isn't a huge leap.
233	0.5145	Paper-based systems tend to be less suitable for tracking. The blockchain's immutable, robust records, secure mapping at the time of creation, and the use of smart contracts can make monitoring customs border trade more efficient and transparent.

The authorizations for the handling of transactions are assigned by a central authority. This approach is particularly interesting when business processes are determined by government or similar regulations. The central authority is accountable to regulators and therefore has a strong interest in compliance and data security and integrity in the blockchain.
40	0.5277	Articles in the press have questioned whether blockchain technologies, as they exist now, are sufficiently reliable to deploy on a large scale.

159	0.5218	At a time when trust is elusive, the appeal of blockchain technology is increasing as it provides a way to confirm, validate, and authenticate values and events. For this reason, vertical (e.g. banking, manufacturing and insurance) and horizontal business lines (departments such as accounting, fulfillment, supply chain and shipping) are linked together via blockchains. As we already know, a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or ledger that uses encryption techniques for the permanent and forgery-proof recording of transaction data. This data is kept distributed in a peer-to-peer network. Each transaction is checked for validity by means of a consensus. 
154	0.5184	Robustness against manipulation.

20	0.5236	Cross-border: Funds or assets can be sent to someone on the other side of the globe as easily as to someone in the next room. Speed: Due to the flat and transparent structure of the blockchain, transfers are displayed almost immediately and usually confirmed in minutes instead of hours or days.
183	0.4952	Lack of user acceptance. Blockchain faces two conflicts: Transparency vs. data protection and Security vs. Speed
35	0.4949	Manufacturing companies and other similar companies also see some potential to use blockchain to manage smart contracts and track materials as they move through their supply chains. Experts believe that blockchain can be used in tax collection, asset transfers, distribution of social benefits, and even voting procedures such as elections. Blockchain can also be used to exchange legal and similar documents such as certificates, testimonials and proofs.
229	0.4923	Systems for tracking products in the recyclable materials chain Companies can use IoT sensors and blockchain to show that they meet compliance requirements or customs regulations through the traceability of their products. One of the challenges in compliance is transparency in traceability. Blockchain makes it easier to implement traceability. For example, there is a world health organization guide on good distribution practices for the distribution of pharmaceutical products.
184	0.4773	Transparency versus data protection. The blockchain presents the ownership rights based on the entire history of the transaction data, which is open to all. As a result, the blockchain resembles a public trade repository or a public ledger. Being open and transparent is the core concept of blockchain for verifying ownership. This openness is the basis for solving the problem of double spending, since anyone can check the transactions of all the others and thus easily uncover duplicate expenses.
19	0.4707	The decentralized structure of the blockchain, unlike traditional centralized approaches, brings with it several important features: Transparency: It is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one account to another. Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be undone. Low cost: Transaction fees are minimal.
231	0.4651	Companies can use a blockchain for tracking systems to ensure compliance. Blockchain provides a system for capturing supply chain data that can be shared both securely and transparently with all actors involved in the supply chain, reducing administrative costs and processing times. In this way, customs could verify the shipping data of an entire supply chain. Any efforts to manipulate the broadcast would be verifiable. Items in supply chains already have barcodes, so capturing items after they've been placed on a global blockchain for IoT tracking isn't a huge leap.
42	0.4649	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked. Their role must be defined if they are to take on certain roles in the blockchain context. Overall, blockchain technology can support a number of models around the handling of business processes by promoting faster settlement, transparency through digitization, symmetrical dissemination of information in supply chains, and the creation of ad hoc trust even between Internet of Things (IoT) services.
234		Improving Efficiency in Recruiting with Blockchain: Validating Facts and Enhancing Trust
234	0.6995	Human resource management. Could a blockchain increase the efficiency of recruiting due to its ability to validate facts and transactions? Blockchains could store details of one's own educational or professional experience and important personal facts that are immutable in certificate registers. Costs associated with repeated checks of the same information could be significantly reduced and confidence in the search increased, provided that the original input was correct.
235	0.6687	Education has also changed drastically in recent years and is now much more difficult to track and validate. Candidates may have worked for multiple employers, gaining skills, knowledge, and experience in the process. You can also have completed online training and earned certificates there. Because people and their backgrounds can be so complicated, the use of blockchain in the recruitment process has some interesting elements.
240	0.6302	While most experts agree that blockchain will eventually be used by human resources for hiring and administrative purposes, the use of blockchains is not yet in sight here. In contrast to financial applications, recruitment, CVs or job histories do not yet have use cases that credibly demonstrate trustworthy use in the management of histories. This means that the use of blockchain technology will initially be limited to the review and documentation of education and training.
238	0.5975	Blockchains could be helpful in making educational information more transparent and making it accessible to businesses and organizations that might need that information in the future. In addition, a blockchain could also track an employee from job to job and provide that employee with a fast and reliable means to have education and work records at hand and forward faster. The trusted security of the blockchain can additionally help employers and employees when it comes to international recruiting, where it becomes necessary to apply for the right work permits and realize secure payments abroad.
237	0.5604	Another big advantage is the cost reduction. Time for checking the evidence of applicants from foreign universities and schools themselves is very time-consuming. A blockchain registration for the validation of  institutions would greatly contribute to the reduction of this time-consuming verification. HR departments would want this secure information in blockchain form to combat fraud and also to reduce the cost of verification.
42	0.5340	Reporting and Auditing: Authentication, authorization, and auditing requirements. In a corporate world with access verification, all participants of the blockchain network should be able to be identified and tracked.

217	0.5301	They can recognize the re-registration of long-standing passive network participants as trusted members. Blockchain can support the growth and development of IoT, including fraud management, identity management, authentication, authorization, billing, and audits. The sheer volume dimension of IoT creates new management problems that existing systems have not yet faced. Automating many, if not all, aspects of operations will be crucial, and blockchain is well positioned to take on critical roles here.
163	0.5151	Public (permissionless) blockchains (without access permissions)are attractive to applications such as Bitcoin, which are designed to ensure that no one can control who can participate, and that actors want to remain anonymous and may not be anxious to reveal their identity. Bitcoin's PoW was a real innovation that set the entire blockchain technology in motion. Eligible blockchains have evolved as an alternative design of a blockchain between a group of well-known actors. An empowered or private blockchain offers the opportunity to secure interactions between a group of actors who share a common goal but do not fully trust each other.
46	0.5105	The original goal of the blockchain was to support electronic payment systems based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. This basis remains in place, while the diversity of scopes has increased considerably. The primary goal of blockchain is to ensure the anonymity of its users. This is achieved by using a public/private key pair. Each participant is identified by the public key, and authentication (of transactions, for example) is done by signing with the private key.
51	0.5101	The two most important integrity threats in peer-to-peer systems are technical failures and members with malicious intent. Dishonest and malicious actors pose the greatest threat to the peer-to-peer system because they attack the foundation on which a peer-to-peer system is based: trust. As soon as users can no longer trust each other, they turn away and leave the system. Achieving integrity and trust is the challenge that blockchain technology faces.
235		Harnessing the Potential of Blockchain in Education and Recruitment
235	0.8013	Education has also changed drastically in recent years and is now much more difficult to track and validate.

The trusted security of the blockchain can additionally help employers and employees when it comes to international recruiting, where it becomes necessary to apply for the right work permits and realize secure payments abroad.
236	0.6108	For the blockchain to undeniably reflect a resume or employment history, the question of who brings the data into each block and who verifies the data is crucial. In some use cases, such as review of financial statements, the answers to these questions are relatively simple. Schools and universities could already make data blocks available to their students in which information on the respective educational path and the achievements achieved are documented. In a blockchain world, the transcripts, certificates, and testimonials would be tamper-proof and basically signed by the issuing institution.
237	0.6018	Another big advantage is the cost reduction. Time for checking the evidence of applicants from foreign universities and schools themselves is very time-consuming. A blockchain registration for the validation of  institutions would greatly contribute to the reduction of this time-consuming verification. HR departments would want this secure information in blockchain form to combat fraud and also to reduce the cost of verification.
34	0.5610	The areas of application are manifold and can certainly not be described conclusively here. Much of the early interest in blockchain technology arose around its application in financial transactions. This is understandable when you consider that the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been used worldwide, proving that blockchain technology can actually work. Banks and other financially relevant institutions have also become early innovators in this area. Other industries, including healthcare, the public sector, agriculture, energy, and many more, are exploring how they can use blockchain to enable the secure exchange of data such as personal health information, digital assets, or real estate data.

39	0.5569	Experts cite several important benefits for using blockchain. Security is considered one of the main advantages of this technology. It is almost impossible to manipulate a blockchain because information from thousands, even millions of computers, is shared and constantly compared with each other. In addition, blockchain does not have a singular point of failure. If one node fails, this is not a problem because all other nodes have a copy of the ledger. Whether blockchain will revolutionize the way public administration, institutions and industries work is an open question.
35	0.5436	Manufacturing companies and other similar companies also see some potential to use blockchain to manage smart contracts and track materials as they move through their supply chains.

Other industries, including healthcare, the public sector, agriculture, energy, and many more, are exploring how they can use blockchain to enable the secure exchange of data such as personal health information, digital assets, or real estate data.
